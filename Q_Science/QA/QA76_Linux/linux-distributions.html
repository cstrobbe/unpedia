  <h2 id="generalinfo">General Information About Linux Distributions</h2>
  <p>The large majority of existing Linux distributions are based on a small set of other, usually independent, distributions,
    namely Debian, openSUSE, Fedora, Arch, Gentoo or Slackware. Many are based on Ubuntu, which is itself based on Debian.
    Of course, there are other independent distributions, such as Solus, Dragora and Void Linux.
    <!--See DistroTube: "The Big Seven Linux Distributions", 18 minutes, 28.02.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh-TZlWLcRA -->
  </p>
  <p>Most of the distributions listed on this page are for general purpose use, but some of these serve a specific purpose.
    In addition to everyday desktop computing, there are also Linux distributions for embedded computing,
    deployment on old devices with few resources, security testing, etcetera.
    <br />For example, the following distributions focus on specific audiences, tasks or hardware characteristics:
  </p>
  <ul>

    presents sixteen questions about how you prefer to use operating systems and applications,
    and, based on your answers, presents a list of Linux distribution that fit your criteria.

  <p>Linux distributions are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
  <p class="a11y-info-intro">The list below also tracks whether a distribution provides documentation on <strong>accessibility and assistive technologies</strong>,
    or has an accessibility team or contributors focusing on these aspects of <abbr title="human-computer interaction">HCI</abbr>.
    In the case of commercial distributions, this may include mentioning whether there is a

      (Switched to Linux, 15 minutes, 30.05.2019): this video finds the website very corporate and the documentation useless.
      The reviewer poins out that, by defuault, Clear Linux auto-updates everything just like Windows.
      (Running it inside Virtual Box requires version 6 of that hypervisor.)
      <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OMTucIt-uo">Clear Linux is the Devil But We Can Learn From It</a>
      (Chris Titus Tech, 7 minutes, 08.06.2019): this video is critical of Clear Linux because of its telemetry (which the comments identify as an opt-in feature)
      and its automatic updates, features that have put users off Microsoft Windows.
      Another negative aspect is its package manager swupd.
      Positive aspects are its delta updates for packages and its optimisations for Intel processors.

    <p class="a11y-info">Debian is one of a relatively small number of Linux distribution projects that have an <strong>accessibility</strong> project:
      <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/">Debian-Accessibility</a>:
      <q>Debian-Accessibility is an internal project to develop Debian into an operating system that is particularly well fit for the requirements of people with disabilities.
      The goal of Debian-Accessibility is a completely accessible system which offers users with disabilities the highest possible amount of independence, built completely on free software.</q>
      The
      <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/accessibility-maint">wiki page accessibility-maint</a>
      contains essential accessibility information for package maintainers.
      <br />Outside the official Debian project, Simon Kainz created
      <a href="https://familiekainz.at/a11y/">check-a11y</a>,
      a tool that automatically checks the status of accessibility support in various desktop environments that are supported by Debian.

        (<i class="ytchannel">InfinitelyGalactic</i> on YouTube, 19 minutes, 04.12.2018).
        <br />These tweaks assume that you are running Gnome. The tweaks concern the addition of repositories,
        the installation of Gnome Tweak Tool, turning off Gnome's search facility (in Gnome Tweak Tool),
        the installation of Microsoft fonts (including the new font rendering engine that Microsoft open-sourced),
        screen calibration, <abbr>GUI</abbr> tweaks (including themes and adding
        <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/">Gnome's Dash to Panel</a>),
        installing Timeshift as a backup tool, and more.
        At the end of the video, Gnome looks significantly differently from the default installation.

      contains the following information related to privacy (accessed 10.11.2019):
      <blockquote>
        <p>Counting <abbr>IP</abbr> addresses has the disadvantage that many machines are hidden behind proxy servers or masquerading routers.
          In order to get a more accurate view on the number of installations the openSUSE project instead counts unique Zypper <abbr>UUID</abbr> signatures hitting download.opensuse.org.
          This <abbr>UUID</abbr> string is a random label that is created during an installation. The openSUSE project does not use this id to track anything but to count.
        There is no way to relate this random string to a user or machine.</p>
        <p>The <abbr>UUID</abbr> is stored in the file /var/lib/zypp/AnonymousUniqueId. In order to not have an installation counted for the statistics the file can be removed or emptied.
        Alternatively online repositories can be switched to use a specific mirror server instead of the automatic redirector on download.opensuse.org.</p>

        <a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/team/">Ubuntu MATE Team page</a>
        lists Jonathan Nadeau as a contributor for <q>assistive technology advisor and accessibility testing</q> (last checked on 09.10.2019).
        Accessibility was also mentioned in Bryan Lunduke's interview with Martin Wimpress:
        <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3062563/meet-the-man-behind-ubunto-mate.html">Meet the man behind Ubuntu MATE</a>.
        Martin Wimpress said,
        <q>I also believe that computing has to be accessible to all. And thanks to MATE’s GNOME2 heritage, we have just about the best accessibility integration available.
        Ubuntu MATE has been tested, and endorsed, by members of the Accessible Computing Foundation for use by blind or visually impaired individuals.</q>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/roadmap/">Ubuntu MATE's roadmap</a>
        contains the following section about accessibility (accessed on 17.10.2019):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Making an accessible operating system was a key priority when the Ubuntu MATE founders initially set out the goals of the project.</p>
        <p>Ubuntu MATE is never going to be able to offer the comprehensive integration of assistive technologies that Sonar GNU/Linux provides.
          But we will continue to follow their lead so that Ubuntu MATE is a viable desktop solution where computer access is shared within a household or business where individual needs differ.
        </p>
        <p>The upstream MATE Desktop team are actively engaged with visually impaired users from the Linux community to ret and ensure their needs are met.
          This effort will like never be complete, it requires constant refinement.

      Topics include the early goals of Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr><!--7:00--> (making Linux user friendly for people who wanted to switch
      over from Windows or Mac <abbr>OS</abbr> to Linux), taking on feedback from diehard Linux users
      (they looked at it very closely and noticed that different types of users had different types of feedback; Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr> was not only meant for new users),
      <!--17:18-->the tension between creating a familiar user experience versus an intuitive user experience
      (Zorin uses a blend of both: some user experience elements are similar across operating systems and for good reasons,
      and if a new user encounters a usability problem, that may put them off Linux. However, the developers don't want Zorin to look exactly like Windows),
      releases that made a bigger impact (version 3, version 8 when Windows XP was losing support, and version 15),
      the expected user base (for example, the Italian city of
      <a href="https://zoringroup.com/blog/2016/04/29/the-city-of-vicenza-is-choosing-zorin-os/">Vicenza switched over from Windows to Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr></a> in 2016),
      <!--31:55-->monetising Linux projects and keeping them sustainable if they are not funded by a big company such as Intel,
      <!--39:09-->partnerships with hardware vendor in order to get Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr> preinstalled on computers,
