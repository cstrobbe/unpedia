          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/myHITuni"><abbr>HI</abbr>Tuni - The High Intensity Training University</a>,
          for example the video
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYnx49pTqhc">Doug McGuff, <abbr>MD</abbr> on The Best Routine, Frequency of Training and Recovery for the Over-40s | <abbr>HI</abbr>Tuni</a>
          (5 minutes, 21.05.2018).
          This is about exercises that are chosen to that most of the concentration is focused on effort instead of co-ordination.
          This results in the following types of exercises:
          (1) an upper-body push in the horizontal plane, (2) an upper-body pull in the horizontal plane, (3) an upper-body push in the vertical plane, (4) an upper-body pull in the vertical plane and (5) a pressing movement with the lower body.
          You may also want a hinging movement around the hips, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> some sort of lumbar extension or a Roman chair extension, superman on the floor or even a deadlift.
          <br />These big body movements will cover most of the musculature throughout the body.
          In the beginning, you can start Monday-Wednesday-Friday and after a few days move to a Monday-Thursday frequency. If you are feeling fatigued, you can change that to Monday-Friday-Wednesday.
          Improvements don't necessarily follow the pattern workout-recovery-improvement; sometimes it follows the pattern of a few workout-recovery cycles before improvement can be seen.
          In one of the comments, HiTuni / Doug McGuff explains what the big five exercises are:
          <ul>
            <li>a lower body push, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> leg press or squat,</li>
            <li>an upper body horizontal pull, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a multi-joint row,</li>
            <li>an upper body horizontal push, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a chest press or bench press,</li>
            <li>an upper body vertical pull, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a pulldown or chin-up.</li>
          </ul>
          Doug McGuff also answers a number of questions in the comments:
          <dl class="q-a-list">
            <dt class="question">I always hear people talk about protein synthesis and that after 48 hours your muscles stop growing and you should hit them again. But in my opinion your muscles don't start growing until their repaired.</dt>
              <dd class="answer">Muscles also don't suddenly start atrophying just because protein synthesis has returned to baseline. Just looking at protein synthesis is too narrow of a perspective.</dd>
            <dt class="question">(&hellip;) I will do a HIT routine, train to failure on all major muscle groups, but I am putting on top of that some follow up exercise because I worry that maybe I didn't really train to failure.
            I will usually try another round or two of hit later in the day, either with fewer reps top failure or with a lower weight. The maybe some isolation exercises like dumbel curls to failure. Also some negatives. (&hellip;)</dt>
              <dd class="answer">2x <abbr>HIT</abbr> workouts per week is enough resistance training, adding more will likely hinder rather than help results- and can lead to that wiped out feeling you describe. Focus on getting good at going to momentary muscular failure safely and you will have done what needs to be done!</dd>
            <dt class="question">What other workouts is he doing besides Big 5?? I can’t find anything anywhere on cardio recommendations. Is he walking? Jogging?</dt>
              <dd class="answer">As Childish Gamebino mentioned the "cardio" is in the workout. The metabolic impact of performing sets to momentary failure is akin to sprinting. Being physically active, walking etc. between HIT workouts is a good thing,
              but there is no need for a formal schedule- just be spontaneously active!</dd>

              Jeff Cavaliere judges exercises based on their risks-to-benefits ratio.
              - 1:22: chest flys: at the bottom of the movement, the exercise no longer stretches the chest but the coracobrachialis; going too far down can cause a torn pec.
                2:41: alterative: cable cross over (standing)
              - 2:51: behind-the-neck should press involves pushing in an abnormal plane of motion, which increases the risk of impingement. Alternative exercises have the elbows in front of your body.

              Pros: (1) It is inexpensive, since you don't need to pay for equipment or a gym membership.
              (2) You can do bodyweight exercises anywhere; (3) bodyweight exercises are typically more athletic because they are compound movements (whereas exercises involving weights tend to isolate muscles).
              (4) Bodyweight exercises are good for conditioning and fat loss (compound movement allow you to burn more body fat).
              4:29: Cons: (1) Bodyweight exercises are not necessarily the best fit if you are trying to train around in injury, since it is harder to isolate specific joints etc.
              (2) Bodyweight exercises require more co-ordination (however, this can be trained also).
              (3) It is harder to progress, unless you understand very well how your body is moving, while you can easily add weight to a bar to make progress. this can cause you to plateau.
              (4) It is a myth that you can't use bodyweight exercises to build muscle or to get strong, but you need to know how to do it.

              This video is not about a secret exercise but about being aware of your own efforts and not taking sets or reps off.
              "I think that many of us simply get comfortable in our workouts.  We start to call them workout routines.
              Nothing should be routine about your training other than the fact that you routinely show up to perform them.
              When it comes to your intensity levels however when doing your workouts I would bet that you are likely falling a little short in that department."
              "Regardless, the key is that you become self aware of your own efforts before every workout that you do.
              Once you know that you can likely fall into the trap of taking sets and reps off then you will be more likely to intervene and not do this."

              There is a range of body fat percentages at which your abs can become visible, even up to 19% body fat for men and 23% for women.
              You need to determine the body fat percentage that you are starting from and what level if visibility (or body fat) you want to achieve.
              You can then calculate approximately how long it should take to achieve your goal.
              If you choose to achieve your goal through a combination of nutrition and training, Jeff recommends a method that involves
              a caloric deficit of 500 calories per day through nutrition cuts and an additional 250 calorie deficit through training.
              This should result in a weight loss of 1.5 lbs (or 0.68 kilo) per week.
              (Jeff uses the example of a person weighing 200 lbs or 91 kilogram and 30% body fat at the start who needs to lose 40 lbs to reach 10% body fat.)

              There is value to quarter squats. It is an exercise that focuses on the top range of motion, where you are strongest, just like the pin press or a mat-elevanted deadlift.
              The quarter squat can be beneficial for vertical jump height compared to the half squat and the full squat, according to a study published on PubMed.
              The downside was a loss in 40-yard sprint times.
              When doing quarter squats, you need to follow three rules: (1) you need to hinge from the hips and bend the knees,
              (2) quarter squats don't count towards personal records, and (3) you need to be willing to load the barbell more heavily then for a regular squat.
              In addition, the quarter squat should be used as a complement to the full squat, not as a replacement.
              There is also a variation of the quarter squat that is not performed at the top of the range of motion but at the bottom.
              This exercises trains the legs in their weaker range.

              You need to look at your muscle fiber dominance (type 1 or type 2).
              Those with a higher type-2-muscle fiber dominance will benefit from low-volume work, whereas type-1-dominant people will benefit from high-volume work.
              In addition the more training experience you have, the higher your intensity needs to be.
              You should use a multitude of rep ranges for hypertrophy. See Charles Poliquin (Principles) and Brad Schoenfeld.

              Targeting some specific muscles can be difficult without weights.

              There are various ways in which you can do them, i.e. with regard when you have resting periods.
              4:50: If your goal is hypertrophy, then supersets are worth considering. However, if your goal is performance related, for example power or velocity, then supersets are not recommended.
              [Cf. Weakley et al: The Effects of Superset configuration on Kinetic, Kinematic, and Perceived Exertion in the Barbell Bench Press. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, August 2017

              An example of an agonist-antagonist superset would involve a barbell benchpress and a backrow, whereas the barbell benchpress and pushups would involve the similar-biomechanical movements.

              Well, sort of. Celebrity workouts are just like other workouts, actually. Don't expect to end up looking just like the celebrity you are imitating.
              According to one &ldqou;celebrity trainer&rdquo; <q><abbr>HIIT</abbr/> is the most powerful way to build strength and tone your body (...) [and] it's also the most effective way to target belly fat.</q>
              The man does apparently not realise that different training protocols have different outcomes. HIIT cannot hit all of these goals, i.e. strength, &dlquo;toning&rdquo; and reducing body fat.
              HIIT is not a suitable protocol for increasing strength because it involves short rest periods, while strength training involves longer rest periods.
              HIIT is not the most suitable protocol for muscle definition either, again because it involves short rest periods and is designed to keep your heart rate at a high level.
              We should also adapt our training as we age: the older we get, the more we need to focus on recovery. Resistance training should be less frequent.
              And even younger people should think about longevity.

              You can add 200 calories to your nutritional program by adding, for example, another cup of rice every single day.
              2:16: As long as you are getting the right amount of protein, you should add carbohydrates, since these also help build muscle, and then evaluate your progress at the end of every week.

              A certain Dr. Joel Seedman has been posting videos with dangerous exercises on Instagram, for example, front curled squats on a MOBO board.
              3:46: Alan Roberts points out that foot placement in squats (how far apart your feet are and the angle of your feet) are very individual,
              since it depends on anatomical factors such as the length of your femur, the length of your shin, the length and angle of the neck of the femur and how your hip socket is made.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 09.05.2018).
          <br />Alan Roberts sells several training programmes on his site, for example
          <a href="https://everydamndayfitness.net/collections/e-d-d-f-signature-series-programs/products/e-d-d-f-lean-mass-hypertrophy-program"><abbr>E.D.D.F.</abbr> LEAN MASS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM</a>

          In this no-nonsense video, he explains that he once considered creating a programme for beginners and why he decided not to do that after all.
          Beginners should learn the four basic lifts (the bench press, the squat, the deadlift and the overhead press), but these exercises shouldn't be taught using distance learning.
          The reason is that there are both mental and physical variables that need to be taken into account by a coach who is physically present can correct (and a video can't).
          Physiological variablese that need to be taken into account include height, weight, age, body fat percentage, the length of the femur, even the length of the femur's neck.
          <br />For this reason, Alan Roberts recommends that beginners should find a strength coach who can teach the four basic lifts in person.
          After about six months of getting proficient at these exercises, beginners can start worrying about curls or a novice programme,
          <abbr>i.e.</abbr> a three-times-per-week full-body programme that builds on the four basic lifts.
          Males who have between 12 and 20% body fat shouldn't worry too much about nutrition as long as they stay withing that range.
          If beginners start aiming for caloric deficits in order to make their abs visible, they will rob themselves of what Alan Roberts calls "noob gains" or lean mass gains.
          As long as you eat healthy (with sufficient protein, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass) and work out hard using the four basic lifts,
          you will develop a good-looking physique.
          Alan Robets doesn't believe in supplemenation for beginners; they should be getting enough protein through regular food.
          He stresses the fact that training needs to be consistent: <q>fitness is a lifestyle</q>.

          <br />In the traditional upright row, the elbows end up above the shoulders and the wrists, which requires internal rotation in the shoulders.
          The authors propose modifications to the technique to make it safe and effective.
          The bar should be raised through the elbows, not the wrists, and should move as close to the body as possible.
          In addition, the arms should be raised so they make an angle of at most 90° with the upper body.
          The authors also make recommendations regarding training volume, rest periods and weight.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Men's Health</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 27.11.2018).
          <br />Luke Zocchi, Chris Hemsworth's personal trainer, explains the workout he designed for Hemsworth for the film <i>Men in Black: Internationalk</i> (2019).
          The workout was designed to achieve a less bulky look than Thor and to be doable while travelling, so it involves only bodyweight and a pair of dumbbells.
          <!--1:30-->It starts with a warm-up that involves bear crawls (10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds) and
          bodyweight squats (also 10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds).
          <!--2:32-->The other exercises are weighted burpee (8 reps), curl to press (8 reps), goblet squats (8 reps), standing triceps extensions (8 reps), reverse lunge curls (8 reps),
          a shoulder excercise that cycles through a lateral raise, a front raise and an upright row (8 reps), and three plank variations:
          plank punches (8 reps), plank pulses (8 reps) and plank pikes (8 reps).
          This set of exercises are done in a cycle for thirty minutes.
          <br /><strong>Warning</strong>: Skip or replace the upright rows in the shoulder exercise;
          the upright row demonstrated in this video raises the elbows above shoulder level, which brings your shoulders into internal rotation,
          and this can be harmful to the shoulder joints.
