          <br />This is the first video with a musical intro and the first to mention ATHLEANX.com; Athlean comes from athletic + lean.
          This  is also the first &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video. The

          <br />This is the second &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video, which assumes you have been doing the exercises from the first video for a while.
          In the introductory part of the video, Jeff stresses the importance of hydration using water instead of coffee.
          He says that you don't need cardio to strip of fat; a combination of diet and strength training should work.
          Instead of worrying about high-carb or low-carb diets, he recommends getting rid of foods that contain a lot of fats
          (sweets, chocolate, butters, cream sauces, mayo, etcetera).
          <br />He then goes on to demonstrate ab exercises that you can do every day of the week.
          (The <a href="https://youtu.be/0hU5dSlWqK8?t=208">actual exercises start at 3:28</a>.)
          The exercises are the ISO reverse crunch, &ldquo;one down, two up&rdquo;, the med ball balance crunch, the commando crunch
          and the standing tubing over twist.
          <br />In the comments, Jeff recommends doing the ab workout three times per week and gradually increasing the frequency to five times per week.

          In one of the comments, responds to someone saying that sport-specific exercises are a bit overrated:
          <blockquote>I agree with your view of "functional" exercise being overdone.  However, I define "functional" or "sports specific" as purposeful exercise.
            Exercises that have purposeful carryover to the movements that occur on the field are not only rightfully placed in an athlete's training program but necessary if you want to maximize performance.
            This and other exercises I recommend are based on real world results with some of the top players in <abbr>MLB</abbr>.

          <br />This is the third &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.<!--Mentions that the weather is getting nice in Connecticut, which provides excuses for not working out.-->
          <!--1:58-->Jeff points out that the workouts he describes take only ten minutes, so it should be feasible to fit into your schedule.
          The exercises that Jeff demonstrates are &ldquo;Plate Eight&rdquo;, the Recline Press Crunch, the Side Pillar Twist (also known as Side Plank Rotations),
          the Physioball Rollout and the Physioball Skier Tucks.

          This video demonstrates an exercise called &ldquo;pitcher's curl and crunch&rdquo;, with a rope attached to a high cable machine.

          <br />This is the fourth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          This episode focuses more on speed: you don't need to do a thousand crunches if you slow down the tempo.
          Jeff advises to not only copy his exercises but his tempo as well. He then demonstrates the following exercises:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets of 10 reps), tubing punch and crunch (2 sets of 12 reps each side),
          V-up slow twists (using a medicine ball, 2 sets of 10-12 reps),
          medicine ball &ldquo;2 1 &rdquo; (2 sets of 21 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 3-way x 7) and
          rolling planks (2 sets of 12 complete rolls).

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGdCC1Jomgw">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 5 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 13.05.2009).
          <br />This is the fifth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          Jeff demonstrates a new set of more difficult exercises:
          mad ball plank switches (2 sets of 12 switches each side, using a medicine ball that is small enough so you can grab it using a single hand),
          med ball cross knee tuck (2 sets of 10 to each side),
          figure eights (2 sets of 8 to 10 eights),
          tubing Russian twists (2 sets of 15 reps to each side) and
          physioball running man (2 sets of 12 reps each leg).
          <br />In the second half of the video, Jeff answers a question about nutrition, more particularly cheat meals.
          He says, <q cite="https://youtu.be/EGdCC1Jomgw?t=176">If you stay away from that stuff long enough, you'll start to lose your cravings for it</q>.
          In addition, seeing your gains may increase your willpower to stay away from cheat meals.
          <!--3:25-->If you eat five times per day, as Jeff recommends, totalling 35 meals per week, you can be a little free in what you eat five times.
          However, it is better to consistently eat healthy food.

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9p6Nwmc6Nw">Insider Training Blog Episode I - Upper Body Dynamic Warmup</a> (6 minutes, 19.05.2009).

          <br />In episode 6 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;,  Jeff first discusses supplements. He points out that many supplements available on the market
          are not good for your health; these include fat burning pills. Instead, you should rev up you metabolism by eating five to six times a day and spreading these meals two to three hours apart.
          However, since eating five to six times per day can be difficult, protein bars and protein shakes can come in handy. Some
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid">fatty acids</a> (omega-3) and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine">creatine</a> (if you drink enough water) can also be good.
          <br />The ab exercises<!--2:05--> he demonstrates are the following:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets until failure), hanging corkscrews (2 sets until failure),
          hanging &ldquo;around the clocks&rdquo; (2 sets until failure), pretzel reverse crunches (2 sets of 15 on each leg; no rest between switching legs) and

          more specifically a hitter. He demonstrates an exercise in which he keeps one leg (on the side from which the bat swing starts)
          on a <abbr>BOSU</abbr> ball and repeatedly moves his other foot from the ball to the ground and back.

          <br />In episode 10 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;, Jeff explains that he skipt a week to see what YouTube viewers had been doing:
          skip training, repeat week 9 or something else? He also explains that recovery is important.
          Starting at 2:40, Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:
          three-way ab wheel-outs (3 sets of 12 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 4 rounds of middle, left and right),

          <br />After a three-minute introduction, Jeff answers a question from a baseball player about how to hit the ball with more power.
          He demonstratese a bodyweight exercise that increases flexibility in the hips.

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI">How To Build Bigger Biceps with the Athlean X Biceps Blast</a> (9 minutes, 16.07.2009).
          <br />In the introduction, Jeff points out that the AthleanX website has been revamped, after which he explains
          four biceps exercises that he uses as the foundation of his own workouts.
          <!--2:05-->He starts with a straight-bar biceps curl and explains that he allows a little bit of a cheat on this exercise,
          even though he usually stresses correct form. He demonstrates a biceps curl that focuses on the negative, which takes 4&ndash;5 seconds.
          When the biceps get tired, the (minor) cheat on the upward movements allows more reps focusing on the negative movement.
          <br /><!--3:42-->He then demonstrates a chin-up in which the upward movement does not go all the way up but only to a 90° angle between upper arm and forearm;
          at the top of the movement, you should hold for a second, then do a slow negative (doing 8&ndash;10 reps).
          <br /><!--4:26-->The third exercise is like a curl but using tubes instead of a bar;
          since this is a lighter exercise, the tempo is a bit faster and the rep count is between 30 and 40.
          The advantage of a resistance band compared to a bar is the different strength curve:
          with a bar, the hardest part is when the forearm is parallel to the floor,
          whereas with a band, the movement becomes harder as the forearms move to the top of the movement.
          <br /><!--6:50-->The final exercise is a dead-arm curl: since the easiest position in a regular curl is at the top,
          this curl exercise is done standing in a baseball fielder position, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> bent over,
          so that the hardest part is at the top of the movement. In this exercise, too, you should focus on the negative.
          <br />Jeff also answered many questions in the comments. In one of his comments, he points out,
          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&lc=UgzvlqYEZkSeBWwZH6J4AaABAg">If you're pressed for time, the great way to perform this workout is by alternating biceps and triceps exercises with little to no rest in between sets!
          Do a set of biceps, immediately move to the rested triceps muscles for a set.  By the time you've completed your triceps move, you're biceps have had a chance to recover!
          You can knock out 9-12 sets of each in less than 20 minutes!</blockquote>
          In another comment, he points out that,
          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&lc=UgxWHhGcJuGCuHFRIVt4AaABAg">Biceps are a small muscle group and don't need much volume to stimulate growth!
          Perform 1 round of each of the exercises (minimizing the rest in between to just enough that allows you to recover for the next exercise)...then rest 2 minutes in between the rounds.
          Perform another round.  Limit it to 2-3 total rounds.</blockquote>
          And again:
          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&lc=Ugx7PoyrZQEujH3qw5F4AaABAg">Biceps are a small muscle group and therefore, to prevent overtraining, respond best to 3 sets of 10-12 reps for about 3 exercises.
          9 sets total is plenty if you are training them with good intensity.  Use an amount of weight that allows you to fail in the given rep range.</blockquote>
          In another comment, he points out that you don't need to train your biceps three times per week; one or twice per week is fine.
          <!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&lc=Ugzo33ZgiuTcq1sb4eR4AaABAg -->
          He also points out that,
          <q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&lc=Ugx4cZgiF3YEfT7zC1R4AaABAg">the biggest factor for biceps size is slowing the negative portion of each exercise.  The biceps responds extremely well to slow negatives.</q>

          <br />In the introduction, Jeff tells viewers to let him know what they want to see next.
          For this video, he visited someone who had sent him a video showing an impressive push-up variation.
        </li>
        <li class="jeff-shirt-off"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn1788YK_VY">Killer Chest Workout - "Chest Chiseling Workout"</a> (9 minutes, 28.07.2009).
          <br />In this video, Jeff demonstrates three pairs of exercises in a circuit (again with his shirt off).
          <!--1:23-->The first exercise is iron-cross pushup using jump bands that hang down from a bar (about 10 reps).
          <!--2:10-->The second exercise is dips in which he keeps his chin to the chest in order to add more stretch to the lower chest.
          He recommends 10 reps with a slight pause at the bottom of the movement.
          <!--3:02-->You should do two or three rounds of these first two stretching exercises.
          <br /><!--3:07-->This is followed by the contraction part of the workout.
          The first exercise uses a resistance band which is pulled to the front of the chest (arm strethed out), then hold for a bit and then back (10 to 12 reps).
          <!--4:10-->The second exercise is a dumbbell pullover for the upper chest (10&ndash;12 reps).
          You should do two to three rounds of these contraction exercises.
          <!--PowerBlock: https://www.joggen-online.de/Fitness-und-Training/Fitnessgeraete/Hanteln-und-Gewichte/Hanteln-und-Gewichte-von-Power-Block

          -->
          <br /><!--5:40-->The last part of the workout consists of compound movements.
          The first exercise is a push-up variation that starts with one hand on the ground and one hand on a med ball.
          At the same time, the leg opposite the side of the med ball is raised off the ground.
          At the top of the push-up movement, the medball is switched to the other hand; at the same time, the leg that is raised is also switched.
          He recommends 20 push-ups.
          <!--6:35-->The last exercise is an incline dumbbell press with the bench set to 40&ndash;45 degrees.
          At the bottom of the movement, there should be a slight pause but the dumbbells should not be lowered below the level of the chest (in order to avoid shoulder problems).
          Jeff recommends 12&ndash;15 reps of this exercises.
          You should do two to three rounds of these compound exercises.

          <br />In response to a request, Jeff shows a triceps workout to complement the earlier biceps workout.
          The exercises in this workout are not done in a circuit; instead, you do one set, rest for 30&ndash;60 seconds, do the next exercise, rest for 30&ndash;60 seconds, and so on.
          After the last exercise, you can go back to the first one again.
          <br /><!--1:10-->The first exercise is kettlebell extensions (while lying on the floor), which you can also do using dumbbells.
          Focus on the negativese and use a weight that is appropriate for 12 reps.
          <!--1:50-->The second exercise is a push-up variation that consists of only the upward part of the dive bomber pushup. He recommends 10&ndash;15 pushups.

          In response to a request for a workout that requires very little equipment, Jeff proposes a workout that only requires a medicine ball.
          This &ldquo;eight-is-enough workout&rdquo; consists of eight exercises:
          20 rolling pushups, 20 triceps pushups, 15 shoulder tosses with the medicine ball, the wiper-crunch combo (10 reps for each side),
          15 rolling squats, lunges with overhead twists (10 reps for each leg), med ball <abbr>RDL</abbr> (10 reps for each leg) and
          30 curl catches.
          <br /><!--1:35-->The rolling pushups are pushup with one hand on a medicine ball and in which the med ball switches sides after each pushup.
          <!--1:57-->The triceps pushups are done with both hands on the ball.
          <!--2:23-->The shoulder tosses are performed in a seated position with the feet of the floor, which works both the core and the deltoids.
          <!--2:55-->In the wiper-crunch combo, you first do wiper movements with the med ball between the knees, followed by crunches with the med ball balanded on the lower legs.
          <!--3:36-->The rolling squats start from a supine position and the med ball overhead; you bring the ball forwards and use the momentum to get into a squatting position and stand up.
          <!--4:16-->During the lunges with overhead twist, you raise the ball during the lunge and bring it down again while moving back to the standing position.
          <!--4:40-->The <abbr>RDL</abbr> is a type of lift with the med ball in which one leg is extended backward in the lower part of the movement.
          <!--5:15-->In the curl catches, you throw up the med ball and catch it while slowing down the downward movement.

          Due to the surgery and his poor shoulders, he needed a program that built up his shoulders again.
          Some of the exercises in P90X program were not feasible for him, while the Athlean-X program worked.

          <br />Jeff describes a circuit that consists of the following exercises:
          hanging corkscrews (8 reps for each side),
          physioball tuck circles (8 clockwise and 8 counterclockwise),
          tubing oblique crunches (15 reps in each direction) and
          med ball carry crunches (20 reps for each side).
          This circuit can be repeated three to five times.
          <br />The hanging corkscrews are like hanging leg raises but with a twist at the end to activate the obliques.
          In the physioball tuck circles, it is also important to turn the hips instead of working the hip flexors.
          The tubing oblique crunches can also be done without bands.
          The med ball carry crunches are side crunches with the legs off the floor.

          <br />This workout consists of two pairs of exercises.
          Each pair of exercises is performed wihout a break between the first and second exercise, followed by one minute of rest.
          This cycle is repeated four times, followed by a one-minute break,
          followed by the next pair of exercises, which is performed the same way.
          The first pair of exercises consists of twisting pullups (to failure) and physioball pullover crunches (12 reps).
          The second pair of exercises consists of thumbs-up pushups (to failure) and dumbbell/kettlebell side lunge rows (12 reps for each side).
          <br />In the twisting pullups, you twist left and right before pulling yourself up.
          The physioball pullover crunches combine a regular pullover with a small crunch.
          The thumbs-up pushups are done with the hands wide apart and the thumbs up.
          In the dumbbell/kettlebell side lunge rows, you slide across and pull the weight up as you come up.

          <br />If you want to build muscle, you need a &ldquo;<strong>time under tension</strong>&rdquo; of about 45&ndash;60 seconds.
          If each rep lasted four seconds and you did 12 reps, your muscles would be under tension for 48 seconds;
          that is the origin of the magic number 12.
          Tension exists both in the positive and the negative portion of a repetition;
          for example, when doing pullups, you could do the reps 2 seconds up and 2 seconds down, or 1 second up and 3 seconds down.
          However, a negative movement of three seconds is more challenging.
          If you spend only 20 seconds on a set, as many people do, you miss opportunities for building muscle.

          Jeff shows how his ab routine can be made even better.
          <br />Instead of ordinary leg raises, Jeff recommends hanging clocks.
          The ordinary physioball tucks focus on the hip flexors too much; instead, Jeff recommends putting only one leg on the ball and simulating a running movement.
          The reverse crunches can be done on a <abbr>BOSU</abbr> ball and with reps that add a twist to activate the obliques more.
          Planks can be made more effective by adding a pull (using a band) towards the body.
          Another plank variation pulls the band towards the opposite knee.
          <br />These exercises can be done in a circuit that is repeated three to five times.

          This &ldquo;four minutes of hell&rdquo; workout consists of the following exercises:
          kettlebell swings in which the kettlebell switches to the other hand at the top of the swinging movement (30 seconds),
          skier hops with the kettlebell (30 seconds),

          are recovering from a workout from the day before, you need to take in food every 2.5 to 3 hours.
          The snacks Jeff suggests are the following: a peanut butter sandwich (on low-calorie bread, less than 80 calories per slices),
          single-serving cans of tuna, cheese wedges (individually wrapped), hard-boiled eggs, yogurt.
          protein bars and protein shakes. You need to drink water with every meal.

          You can test grip strength using a special device, a hand grip dynamometer,<!--1:10, 2:48--> which is rather expensive.

          <br />Just like the triceps contributes a lot to the volume of the upper arm, the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachioradialis">brachioradialis</a>
          contributes a lot to the volume of the forearm. Jeff uses his muscle markers to show where the brachioradialis
          attaches to the humerus and the radius. Unlike true forearm muscles, the brachioradialis has no action on the wrist.
          <br /><!--2:10-->This leads to the question in what position the forearm should be in order to train this muscle: supinated, neutral or pronated?
          In a supinated position, the biceps does the work of flexing the elbow.<!--2:33--> In a neutral grip position the brachioradialis gets also activated.
          <!--2:47-->However, the brachioradialis can also pronate the forearm, so in order to train the muscle, we need both pronation and flexion.
          <br /><!--3:45-->The first exercise you can do is <strong>reverse barbell curls</strong>,
          using either a straight bar with a lower weight (fully pronated position of the forearm)
          or an EZ bar, which brings the wrists a bit closer to a neutral position, which also allows you to use more weight.
          <br /><!--4:39-->The second exercise you can do is the <strong>reverse lat pull down</strong> (towards and past the head).
          <!--5:30-->Instead of the bar, you can also use the ropes you otherwise use for face pulls.
          <br /><!--5:57-->The third exercise you can do is <strong>battle ropes</strong> using a neutral or a pronated grip.
          <br /><!--6:50-->The fourth exercise you can do is <strong>biceps curls</strong> in which you grip the dumbbells close to the plates in the middle of the body
          and then curl while at the same time turning the forearm into a pronated position.
          <br /><!--7:49-->Finally, putting plates back after you're done with an exercise also activates the brachioradialis and is good gym etiquette.

        Jeff Cavaliere judges exercises based on their risks-to-benefits ratio.
        - 1:22: chest flys: at the bottom of the movement, the exercise no longer stretches the chest but the coracobrachialis; going too far down can cause a torn pec.
          2:41: alterative: cable cross over (standing)
        - 2:51: behind-the-neck should press involves pushing in an abnormal plane of motion, which increases the risk of impingement. Alternative exercises have the elbows in front of your body.

        Pros: (1) It is inexpensive, since you don't need to pay for equipment or a gym membership.
        (2) You can do bodyweight exercises anywhere; (3) bodyweight exercises are typically more athletic because they are compound movements (whereas exercises involving weights tend to isolate muscles).
        (4) Bodyweight exercises are good for conditioning and fat loss (compound movement allow you to burn more body fat).
        4:29: Cons: (1) Bodyweight exercises are not necessarily the best fit if you are trying to train around in injury, since it is harder to isolate specific joints etc.
        (2) Bodyweight exercises require more co-ordination (however, this can be trained also).
        (3) It is harder to progress, unless you understand very well how your body is moving, while you can easily add weight to a bar to make progress. this can cause you to plateau.
        (4) It is a myth that you can't use bodyweight exercises to build muscle or to get strong, but you need to know how to do it.

        "I think that many of us simply get comfortable in our workouts.  We start to call them workout routines.
        Nothing should be routine about your training other than the fact that you routinely show up to perform them.
        When it comes to your intensity levels however when doing your workouts I would bet that you are likely falling a little short in that department."
        "Regardless, the key is that you become self aware of your own efforts before every workout that you do.

      - "Body Fat for Abs to Show - The Truth! (MEN AND WOMEN)", 8 minutes, 09.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wqXNZbnZEs
        There is a range of body fat percentages at which your abs can become visible, even up to 19% body fat for men and 23% for women.
        You need to determine the body fat percentage that you are starting from and what level if visibility (or body fat) you want to achieve.
        You can then calculate approximately how long it should take to achieve your goal.
        If you choose to achieve your goal through a combination of nutrition and training, Jeff recommends a method that involves
        a caloric deficit of 500 calories per day through nutrition cuts and an additional 250 calorie deficit through training.
        This should result in a weight loss of 1.5 lbs (or 0.68 kilo) per week.

        There is value to quarter squats. It is an exercise that focuses on the top range of motion, where you are strongest, just like the pin press or a mat-elevanted deadlift.
        The quarter squat can be beneficial for vertical jump height compared to the half squat and the full squat, according to a study published on PubMed.
        The downside was a loss in 40-yard sprint times.
        When doing quarter squats, you need to follow three rules: (1) you need to hinge from the hips and bend the knees,
        (2) quarter squats don't count towards personal records, and (3) you need to be willing to load the barbell more heavily then for a regular squat.
        In addition, the quarter squat should be used as a complement to the full squat, not as a replacement.
        There is also a variation of the quarter squat that is not performed at the top of the range of motion but at the bottom.
        This exercises trains the legs in their weaker range.

  * "Bodybuilding Supplements Video - The SCARY TRUTH", 10 minutes, 10.02.2013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfM_QBYNFs
    - Some supplememnts contain magnesium stearate, which is just added to prevent ingredients from sticking to machinery and which your body does not need.
    - Not every gram of protein in a product will actually be absorbed by the body.
    - Stores that sell supplements are often incentivised by a manufacturer to recommend the manufacturer's products, not to tell you what is best for you.
    - Some pre-workout products contain 1,3-dimethylamylamine (dmaa), which should be banned because it is not healthy. (WebMD: https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1258/1-3-dmaa)
    - Nutrition comes first; supplementation makes no sense if your nutrition sucks.
