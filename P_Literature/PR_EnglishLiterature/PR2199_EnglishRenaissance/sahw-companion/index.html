    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This collection of web resources serves as a &ldquo;companion&rdquo; to the
      <abbr title="massive open online course">MOOC</abbr>
      <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeare-and-his-world">Shakespeare and His World</a>.
      The course was created by Professor 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Bate">Jonathan Bate</a> (Warwick University)
      in co-operation with the 
      <a href="http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/">Shakespeare Birthplace Trust</a>.
      Jonathan Bate is the <abbr>MOOC</abbr>'s lead educator, and he is sometimes joined
      by Jennifer Reid of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
    </p>
    <p>The course ran for the first time in March–May 2014 and had around 11,000 registered learners
      (see <a href="http://www.wbs.ac.uk/news/join-us-in-celebrating-450-years-of-shakespeare/">Join us in celebrating 450 years of Shakespeare</a>,
      Warwick Business School, 02 September 2014).
      The <abbr>MOOC</abbr> had its fifth run on FutureLearn from 20 March till 27 May 2017;
      some of the participants are taking the course for the fifth time,
      for the quality of the course content itself, the lively and interesting comments or both.
      At the time of writing, it is not clear whether the course will be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>The <abbr>MOOC</abbr> is a <strong>10-week course</strong>, with each week focusing on a specific theme.
      Each week is subdivided in &ldquo;steps&rdquo;: one or two introductory steps;
      six steps with a video that presents an object, usually from the collections of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust;
      an assessment that consists of 12 multiple-choice questions;
      a discussion step where learners can comment on their favourite object of the week;
      and a summary step with a video in which Jonathan Bate and Jennifer Reid discuss certain themes
      and ideas from the week. 
      Except for the assessments, each step has a <strong>comments</strong> section. The number of comments
      in each step varies between just a few dozen and several hundreds. 
      Many of these comments contain links to other interesting resources. 
      They also contain enough book recommendations to break anyone's book-buying budget. 
      <br />You can see the 
      <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeare-and-his-world/0/steps/257">first step of the first week</a>
      (without the comments, which are not public) on the FutureLearn website.
      <!-- YouTube videos probably the same as those from the "public" steps. @@TODO check:

    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks 2 to 9 have a <strong>focus play</strong>, and the objects presented in the videos are used
      to illustrate certain excerpts and themes from the plays.
      It is a good idea, though not a requirement, to read the plays before the start of the week.
      For those learners who don't have the time to read the entire plays,
      Jonathan Bate provides a list of four or five scenes that are important to read in the context of the course.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Shakespeare's plays</strong> can be read online, for example on the following websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://opensourceshakespeare.org/">Open Source Shakespeare</a>,
        a website that does not only contain most of Shakespeare's works but also
        advanced search functions and a concordance.
        This is the electronic edition recommended by Jonathan Bate.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Foyer/plays/">Plays and Poems</a> 
        on the website &ldquo;Internet Shakespeare Editions&rdquo; hosted at the University of Victoria in Canada
        and possibly the oldest Shakespeare website that is still online.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://shakespeareswords.com/Works">Shakespeare's Words: Works</a>:
        the texts on this website are those from the editions published by Penguin Books
        (except for <i class="play">Cymbeline</i> and <i class="play">Edward III</i>).
        These texts have annotations in the margins, which is helpful for reading the plays online.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>,
        a website hosting the digital <i class="booktitle">Complete Moby(tm) Shakespeare</i>.
        (See <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/info/moby_shakespeare.php">How Moby Shakespeare Took Over the Internet</a>
        for more background about this edition.)
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/70/">The Oxford Shakespeare</a>,
        a digitised version of the edition prepared by W. J. Craig and originally published in 1914 (and therefore outdated).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- See also Folger Digital Texts: http://www.folger.edu/folger-digital-texts  -->
    <p>However, since Shakespeare's works contain many words, expressions and allusions that
      are obscure to most modern readers, it is a good idea to read a thoroughly <strong>annotated
      edition</strong> of each play. There is a wide choice of annotated editions, for example
      (in no particular order):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/academic/academic-subjects/drama-and-performance-studies/the-arden-shakespeare/">The Arden Shakespeare</a>,
        currently in the hands of Bloomsbury Group;

        published by Palgrave Macmillan;
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.folger.edu/folger-shakespeare-library-editions">The Folger Shakespeare Library Editions</a>,
        published by the Folger Shakespeare Library;
      </li>
      <li>the Shakespeare plays in the series 
        <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Subject-detail.aspx?tid=11202">Norton Critical Editions</a>,
        published by W. W. Norton.
        Not all Shakespeare plays are available in this series. It has editions of the following focus plays:
        <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=11869"><i class="play">The Merchant of Venice</i></a>,
        <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-26422-7"><i class="play">Othello</i></a>,

        <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Antony-and-Cleopatra"><i class="play">Antony and Cleopatra</i></a>,
        <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/webad.aspx?id=10286"><i class="play">The Tempest</i></a>,
        but not <i class="play">The Merry Wives of Windsor</i>, <i class="play">A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> and <i class="play">Henry V</i>.
        <!-- The Spanish Tragedy: http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Spanish-Tragedy 
          The Duchess of Malfi: http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Duchess-of-Malfi 
        -->
      </li>
      <li>The Shakespeare plays published as Collins Classics.
        (The text corresponds to the edition by Peter Alexander, originally published by 
        <a href="http://www.harpercollins.co.nz/9780007386956/">Collins</a> in 1951:
        <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/william-shakespeare-the-complete-works-a-new-edition-edited-with-an-introduction-and-glossary-by-peter-alexander-tudor-edition/oclc/503856341" class="booktitle">William Shakespeare: The Complete Works</a>.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Which edition you choose depends on how seriously you want to study Shakespeare, how much convenience you want and
      how much money you want to spend on books.
      The New Penguin Shakespeare is relatively cheap, but the notes are at the end of the book instead of the bottom of the page.
      The Arden, Cambridge, Oxford, <abbr>RSC</abbr>, Folger and Norton editions have notes at the bottom of the page.
      These editions generally also have more extensive introductions, including explanations about the
      origin of the text and the editorial procedures. So the convenience of having notes on the same page
      as the text comes brings additional materials that would mainly interest serious students and scholars.
      The Norton Critical Editions contain an annotated text of the play, a section with comments by actors,
      a section with extracts from sources used by Shakespeare, a selection of criticism, and sometimes
      also excerpts from later works that were inspired by the play.
    </p>
    <p>The Shakespeare editions in the Collins Classics series sometimes have a glossary at the end of the volume
      (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <i class="play">Othello</i>, <i class="play">The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i class="play">Hamlet</i>, 
      <i class="play">King Lear</i>, <i class="play">Julius Caesar</i>, <i class="play">As You Like It</i> and <i class="play">The Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i class="play"></i>),
      while other plays have notes pages facing the text
      (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> <i class="play">Henry V</i>, <i class="play">A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, <i class="play">Macbeth</i>, 
      <i class="play">Much Ado About Nothing</i>, <i class="play">Twelfth Night</i> and <i class="play">Romeo and Juliet</i>).
    </p>
    <p>It can also be helpful to consult a <strong>glossary</strong> with word definitions that have changed since Shakespeare's time.
      Several glossaries are available, both online and in print:

    <h3>The Authorship Question</h3>
    <p>There are a number of persistent and far-fetched theories claiming that William Shakespeare from Stratford-upon-Avon
      is not the author of the plays attributed to him. 
    </p>

    <p>Some relevant links and books:</p>

      <h2>Humour-ous Intermezzo: Antonio's Sadness</h2>
      <p>In the first scene of <i class="play">The Merchant of Venice</i>, Antonio explains that he is said
        and that he does not know why. His friends try to find an explanation, but he finally says:
      </p>
      <blockquote><p><span class="line">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</span>
        <br /><span class="line">A stage where every man must play a part,</span>
        <br /><span class="line">And mine a sad one.</span></p>
        <cite><i class="play">The Merchant of Venice</i>, <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=merchantvenice&Act=1&Scene=1&Scope=scene#82">Act I, scene 1, lines 82–84</a>.</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Some scholars have tried to explain Antonio's melancholy temperament as a consequence of
        homosexuality (towards Bassanio, who will leave Venice to woo Portia), which could not be expressed in the play.
        It can also be seen as serving a theatrical purpose, namely to prepare the audience
        for Antonio's apathetic attitude in later scenes, especially during the trial scene
        without the need to make the character evolve psychologically during the play.
      </p>
      <p>Is Antonio melancholy in the sense of the theory of the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_temperaments">four temperament or humours</a>
        that Shakespeare often alludes to in his plays? Shakespeare does not make this explicit.

    <h3>Shakespeare and Montaigne</h3>
    <p>One of Shakespeare's sources for <i class="play">The Tempest</i> is 
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essays_%28Montaigne%29"><i class="booktitle">Essays</i></a>
      that the French philosopher
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_de_Montaigne" hreflang="en" lang="fr">Michel de Montaigne</a> (1533 – 1592)
      had started publishing in 1580.
      John Florio's English translation of the <i class="booktitle">Essays</i> was published in 1603.
      There is a similarity in wording between a speech by Gonzalo in Act II, Scene 1 of <i class="play">The Tempest</i>
      and a passage in the essay
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Cannibals">Of Cannibals</a>.

    <p>Week 10 has no focus play. Learners can optionally write a short assignment (300 to 500 words),
      which will then get reviewed by another course participant. In some other FutureLearn courses,
      learners also posted assignments on external sites, using for example the following services:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://write.as/">write.as</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://notehub.org/">notehub.org</a> (good if you are on a mobile device)</li>
      <li><a href="http://fayaa.com/code/new/">fayaa.com</a> (an alternative for learners from China who cannot access the two sites listed above)</li>
