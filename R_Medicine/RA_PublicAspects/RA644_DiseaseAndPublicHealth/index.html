          <q>These actions portray an incoming administration with a casual disregard for evidence, an unwillingness to tap into the expertise around them, and a reckless self-confidence.
          They suggest that, in an outbreak, Trump is more likely to heed his own counsel than that of the Centers of Disease Control (<abbr>CDC</abbr>) and other relevant experts.
          And he is likely to project that counsel to over 17 million followers.</q>

          (<i class="ytchannel">Earthling Ed</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 27.02.2020).
          <br />This is a video about antibiotic resistance, which is caused by two things:
          overuse in human medication and overuse in animal agriculture.
          In a world without effective antibiotics, many medical interventions will become much more dangerous.

          <i class="website">Politico</i>, 04.05.2017.
          <br />Bill Gates has become the second biggest donor to the <abbr>WHO</abbr> (behind the <abbr>USA</abbr>),
          which gives him a lot of influence over the organisation's agenda. According to critics, the <abbr>WHO</abbr>'s priorities have shifted:
          <q>the agency spends a disproportionate amount of its resources on projects with the measurable outcomes Gates prefers, such as the effort to eradicate polio</q>.
          Because of Gates' influence, few people dare criticise him openly.
          <q>Some health advocates fear that because the Gates Foundation’s money comes from investments in big business,
          it could serve as a Trojan horse for corporate interests to undermine <abbr>WHO</abbr>’s role in setting standards and shaping health policies.</q>
          <br />
          <q>The Gates Foundation has pumped more than $2.4 billion into the <abbr>WHO</abbr> since 2000,
          as countries have grown reluctant to put more of their own money into the agency, especially after the 2008 global financial crisis.</q>
          The Gates Foundation's emphasis on polio instead of resilient health systems
          <q>has effectively left <abbr>WHO</abbr> begging for funding for other programs, particularly to prop up poor countries’ health systems before the next epidemic hits.</q>
