          <br />This is the first video with a musical intro and the first to mention ATHLEANX.com; Athlean comes from athletic + lean.
          This  is also the first &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video. The The

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVrALzPc7dM">Plank Progression - From Rookie to RIPPED ABS in 7 Minutes with Planks!</a> (7 minutes, 07.04.2012).
          <br />This video presents a few variations to make the plank exercise more challenging.
          In the first variation, he recommends supporting yourself on your hands instead of on your elbows.
          In the second variation, he puts his feet on a bench.
          In the third variation, he recommends narrowing the base of support, both for the hands and the feet.
          In the final variation, he combines some of the previous principles.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDaXSXjuGc">I HATE PLANKS (and why you should too!)</a> (5 minutes, 15.12.2016).
          <br />Planks is a good exercise but only for those who find it challenging, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> those who can't hold it more than a minute.
          Jeff proposes alternatives that involve rotation and rely solely on body weight.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYX5FpYZA7c">Stop Doing Planks! (DO THIS INSTEAD)</a> (8 minutes, 17.01.2018).
          <br />This video shows more advanced alternatives planks than the video from December 2016. Most of these involve bands or weights.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWEXjdAGCQ">The TRUTH About Planks (IT’S UGLY!)</a> (9 minutes, 04.04.2019).
          <br />This video explains a few weaknesses of the plank exercise and clears up a few mistunderstandings about it (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> benefits for the glutes and posture).
          Near the end of the video, he demonstrates a reverse plank that actually activates the glutes and the interscapular muscles.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aPUBgmG_o">I Did the “Baby Shark Ab Workout” for 30 Days (THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED!)</a> (6 minutes, 18.08.2019).
          <br />Jesse explains he did the Baby Shark ab challenge for thirty days, which resulted in washboard abs (an eightpack according to Jesse).
          Jeff is sceptical.
          <a href="https://youtu.be/M4aPUBgmG_o?t=137">Jesse demonstrates the baby shark workout</a>.
          Jeff then highlights the positive aspects of the thirty-day challenge: first, consistency: abs should be trained daily;
          <!--4:00-->second, constant tension during the entire exercise; third, the workout uses time as a training variable instead of reps.
          <!--4:36-->Jesse adds that this is a short workout; if it isn't hard enough, you can just repeat it.
          <!--4:53-->As a fourth benefit, Jeff points out that it is easier to train to music; the music may distract you from the burn you feel in your muscles.
          <!--5:11-->However, Jeff also adds that Jesse could have chosen a workout from the Six Pack Promise from ATHLEAN-X (available as an app in the app store).

  * "Bodybuilding Supplements Video - The SCARY TRUTH", 10 minutes, 10.02.2013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfM_QBYNFs
    - Some supplememnts contain magnesium stearate, which is just added to prevent ingredients from sticking to machinery and which your body does not need.
    - Not every gram of protein in a product will actually be absorbed by the body.
    - Stores that sell supplements are often incentivised by a manufacturer to recommend the manufacturer's products, not to tell you what is best for you.
    - Some pre-workout products contain 1,3-dimethylamylamine (dmaa), which should be banned because it is not healthy. (WebMD: https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1258/1-3-dmaa)
    - Nutrition comes first; supplementation makes no sense if your nutrition sucks.
  * Cavaliere, Jeff: "The Most DANGEROUS Diet in the World (STOP!)", ATHLEAN-X, 13 minutes, 29.08.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3bRVpy0VtE
    2:43: "The most dangerous diet in the world is the one you can't stick to." Also stay away from the diet cults, i.e. those who say that there is only one right way to feed yourself.
