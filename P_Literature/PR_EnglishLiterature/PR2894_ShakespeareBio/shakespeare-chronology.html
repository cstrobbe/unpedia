  <h2>Introduction (or Warning)</h2>
  <p>The dates in the chronology are based on the 
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian calendar</a></strong>
    that was in use in Shakespeare's time, and which was not replaced with the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>
    until the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750">Calendar (New Style) Act 1750</a>.
    Due to the differences between these two calendars, Shakespeare's birthday is currently celebrated on the wrong day.

  <h2>A Shakespeare Chronology</h2>
  <p>This chronology contains the following categories of dates:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="shax-bio">Dates related to Shakespeare as a private person and his family; some other dates related to Stratford-upon-Avon.</li>
    <li class="shax-work">Dates related to Shakespeare's works and the theatre companies he worked with.</li>
    <li class="shax-source">Dates related to sources used by Shakepeare.</li>
    <li class="date-culture">Other important literary and cultural events.</li>
    <li class="date-history">Various historical and political events.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the chronology below, these categories are mutually exclusive, and the assignment of a few dates to a specific category might seem a bit arbitrary.</p>
