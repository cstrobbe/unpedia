      Not even YouTube is profitable, so any alternatives would be vastly better than YouTube.
      Vimeo has been around as long as YouTube, but you need to pay [beyond a certain volume of videos]. It's for professionnals and businesses, not for the general public. It has bad SEO and a bad search engine.
      Vid.me: similar to Vessel, which was sold to Verizon. Basically a copy of YouTube; not noticeably better. They don't have videos on their homepage.
      Minds.com: Its interface doesn't make sense; SEO is absent; videos are listed as "posts". It looks more like an imitation of Facebook with monetisation functionality from YouTube.
      BitChute.com: looks promising but attracts no views. It's decentralised (peer-to-peer)! Unfortunately, search is provided by DuckDuckGo, so the list of search results has no thumbnails.

      "We are living through a postmodern era in which the grand narratives of religion and political ideology have collapsed. In their place have emerged a crusading desire to right perceived wrongs and a weaponization of identity, both accelerated by the new forms of social and news media. Narrow sets of interests now dominate the agenda as society becomes more and more tribal – and, as Murray shows, the casualties are mounting."

      The origin of the wide-spread idea that vitamin C can cure your cold was a book by Linus Pauling ("Vitamin C and the Common Cold").
      Adults need between 75 and 90 mg of vitamin C per day, and the vitamin can be found in many foods.
      Pauling recommended taking 2000 mg per day, but studies did not find that vitamin C does not shorten a cold significantly.
      2000 mg vitamin C per day increases the risk of diarrhoea and kidney stones.
      Vitamin C is most helpful for people engaged in intense physical exercise, for example marathon runners.
      The best cure for the common cold is rest and hydration.

      Calcium supplements are potentially dangerous because the cause a spike of calcium in the blood that lasts up to eight hours. This increases the risk of blood cots and cardiovascular problems.
      Adults need 500-700 mg of calcium daily. There are a number of vegan sources of calcium, for example: 
      100g of kale contains 139 mg of calcium, 1 cup of collard greens contains 357 grams of calcium, 100g of calcium set tofu contains 350 mg of calcium,
      30 g of almonds contain 75 mg of calcium, 100g of chia seeds contains 631 g of calcium and 1 cup of steamed bok choy contains 158 mg of calcium.
      Calcium-fortified plant milks can also be helpful, e.g. soy, oat and almond milk. The human body absorbs the calcium from soy milk just as well as from cow's milk.
      (See the study "Calcium absorption in Australian osteopenic post-menopausal women: (...)" by Tang, Walter et al, 2010: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20460239 .)
      The ideal sources of calcium are low-oxalate dark green vegetables (except spinach, Swiss chards and beet greens, which contain few calcium that we can absorb).
      These are better sources than fortified milks because they are not processed foods without added sodium salt; they also provide fiber, folate and potassium.
      Drinking fortified milks is still better than talking calcium supplements, because they don't cause huge spikes in calcium levels in the blood.

    * "Do Not Eat Peanut Butter Again, Until You Watch This...",  Dr. Eric Berg DC
      First, the peanut's shell can easily absorb what's in the soil, and since peanuts are heavily sprayed, they absorb a lot of the pesticides, herbicides, fungicides etcetera that are sprayed on them.
      Second, in the USA, peanuts are not GMO but they are crop-rotated with cotton, which has been genetically modified to resist glyphosate (in Roundup). So glyphosate ends up in peanuts.
      When glyphosate started to be used, there was also a spike in peanut allergies, which may not be a coincidental.
      Third, aflatoxin is a poisonous carcinogen produced by certain molds that grow on peanuts (and some other plants); this toxin causes liver cancer.
      Fourth, peanut butter often contains a lot of sugar.
      However, Dr. Berg also mentions positive things about peanut butter.
      First, there is a type of peanut batter called "valencia", which has the lowest amount of aflotoxins.
      Second, when you buy organic peanut butter, you get fewer chemicals such as pesticides and fungicides.
      Third, when peanuts are roasted or germinated, you increase the availability of the nutrients.
      Fourth, chlorophyl can reduce the aflotoxin, so if you consume some salad or other plant containing chlorophyl, you reduce the aflotoxin.
      Fifth, peanuts are comparable in nutritional value to other nuts; they also contain protein.

      It is because must bodies the doctor examines are much too alkaline. Check the symptoms for acidosis versus alkalosis.
      High stress (cortisol) makes your body more alkaline, which then blocks the absorption of calcium (symptoms: twitching in the eye, cramping in the calf, neuritis).
      You also lose potassium, which makes the body even more alkaline.
      People who consume a lot of protein (e.g. protein shakes) also have guanidine (a waste product), which can cause twitching, nerve pain and arthritis. Apple cider vinegar flushes out the guanidine.

      Looks at the study "Vinegar Intake Reduces Body Weight, Body Fat Mass, and Serum Triglyceride Levels in Obese Japanese Subjects" by Tomoo Kondo, Mikiya Kishi, et al (Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 73.8 (2009).
      The study involved only obese subjects, so the results may not extrapolate to lean healthy subjects.
      He also mentions "Influence of tolerability of vinegar as a oral source of short-chain fatty acids on appetite control and food intake" by J. Darzi et al (Internationnal Journal of Obesity, 2013).
      The most important effect of vinegar is that it can lower blood sugar. See the study "Vinegar consumption can attenuate postprandial glucose and insulin responses; a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials" by Farideh Shishebor et al (Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 2017).
      Nippard points out that the beneficial effects are generally larger in subjects with diabetese or insulin resistance.
      He adds that "apple cider vinegar's antiglycemic effect is dependent on the type of carbohydrate you're consuming":
      "It is more effective when taken with complex carbohydrates, and it does not seem to work at all in response to simple sugar consumption" [sugar should be avoid anyhow].
      He says that this is due to the fact that "apple cider vinegar seems to work by inhibiting starch digestion, so it will be most effective when you're eating starchy, complex carbohydrates".

          If people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before that, [a] long time."

      The big networks are waiting to declare Biden's victory in the presidential election. Fox News called Arizona for Biden before any other network did.
      The Associated Press then followed Fox. The New York Times has still not declared Arizona as won for Biden.
      Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch to complain about this. Rupert Murdoch informed Trump that he had lost.
      There are also news reports about Rupert Murdoch calling Mitch McConnell and telling not to feed Trump's conspiracy theories.
      2:00: Hartmann's theory is that all the networks are waiting for Fox to declare Biden as the winner,

      Unfortunately, the Democrats does not want to select presidential candidates that prioritise these issues.

      The election is over, even if Trump should win the recount in Georgia, which is unlikely. Biden will probably win the popular vote by 5%.
      The Democrats were projected to win back the Senate, but it does not look like this will happen.
      They also lost four seats in the House of Representatives.
      Each Democrat who supported Medicare for All was re-elected, including Democrats in swing districts.
      By contrast, several right-wing Democrats lost their seats. Katie Porter, a left-wing Democrat in a swing district, cruised the re-election.
      However, the Democratic establishment try to push the opposite idea: namely that left-wing ideas cause the party to underperform.
      Ilhan Omar, another left-wing Democrat, Ilhan Omar and Rashid Tlaib increased turnout, which in turn helped win Biden Minnesota and Michican, respectively.
      John Kasich in Ohio endorsed Biden, who got obliterated by Trump in Ohio.
      AOC should not call for unifying with the Democratic establishment but attack them for their corruption.
      If the polls had been correct, Joe Biden would have won 351 electoral votes, but he lost North Carolina and Florida.
      Biden underperformed in several states he was supposed to win.
      Kyle Kulinski's worst-case was that Biden would win 321 electoral votes, but Biden did still worse than that.
      The Democrats can't do any better because they don't stand for anything.
      For example, in Florida, there was a direct-ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage, which got 60% of the votes.
      In spite of this, Donald Trump still beat Joe Biden by at least three points in Florida, because Joe Biden had neglected to talk about minimum wage in his speeches and interviews.
      The Democrats did not even manage to win against Mitch McConnell, who blocked a huge stimulus package.
      Stating that they are "not Donald Trump" is not enough for Democrats to decisively win election.
      11:18: Bernie Sanders would have won much more comfortably, winning Ohio and Iowa against Trump.
      However, the Democrats refuse to learn from this, since they are already blaming the left for their poor performance.

      The CNN reporter doing the interviews also points out that the ballots that were burned were not real.
      Some of the Trump supporters consider Steve Bannon and Infowars as reliable sources.
      The Trump supporters can't provide evidence for their claims, and when confronted with evidence that contradicts their claims, they reject it.
