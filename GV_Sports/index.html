          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/physicaltherapyvideo">Bob &amp; Brad</a>
          is a channel by Bob Schrupp and Brad Heineck, two physical therapists from the <abbr>USA</abbr>.
          They humorously call themselves <q>the two most famous physical therapists on the Internet</q>.
          They aim to <q cite="https://www.youtube.com/user/physicaltherapyvideo/about">offer the best "get fit , stay healthy, and pain-free" information directed toward people 0 to 101 years old</q>.
          Their videos cover topics such as pain relief, stretching, abdominal and core strengthening, posture, sleeping positions and flat feet.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjnHUDK6r4N56E6TfXEl2UQ/">Minus the Gym</a>:
          YouTube channel of a certain Ryan from the <abbr>USA</abbr> who claims to be a Certified Personal Trainer.
          His channel focuses on bodyweight exercises for which you don't need to go to a gym.
          See also his website:
          <a href="https://minusthegym.com/">Minus The Gym - Health and Fitness at Home</a>.
          <br />For beginners, see for example the following videos:

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay15dc2cvm0">Beginner Calisthenics Workout At Home (Full Routine)</a>
              (<i class="ytchannel">Minus the Gym</i> on YouTube, 15 minutes, 22.10.2018).
              <br />Ryan recommends doing the proposed routine three times per week, with active resting days in between.
              The routine he describes contains four types of movements: a pulling movement, a pushing movement,
              a lower-body exercise and a hinging movement for the core.
              <br />Ryan demonstrates exercises for beginners that build up to more advanced exercises.
              The pulling movement may be a bent-leg bodyweight row until you can build up to pullups.
              The lower-body exercise may be half squats, full squats (optionally with a calf raise), hop squats or lunges.
              The pushing movement may be wall pushups, incline pushups, standard pushups or other pushup variations.
              The hinge exercise may be lying tucks, lying leg raises or hanging leg raises.
              <br />These exercises are meant to be done in a circuit, with 1&ndash;2 minutes of rest after each circuit.

              <br />This workout relies on supersets: the push and the pull exercises are done back to back;
              the core exercises consist of plank variations; the leg exercises consist of squat variations (sumo squat and close squat).

          (<i class="ytchannel">Calisthenicmovement</i> on YouTube, 15 minutes, 04.12.2020).
          <br />The exercises were ranked based on abdominal activity and all factors that can influence this:
          if an exercise requires a lot of mobility or if it relies strongly on other muscles (especially if fatigue in ohter muscles prevents you from cotinuing the exercise),
          that is used as an argument to rank the exercise lower. This does not imply that you should avoid compound movement to train your abdominals.
          <br />The D rank (worst) has the following exercises: situps (hip flexors, spine), frontlever, planche and the bird dog (which is not bad for absolute beginners).
          The C rank has &ldquo;toes to the bar&rdquo; (requires too much mobility and relies on strong quads), V-up (also requires balance and quad strength),
          the human flag (requires too much shoulder strength) and windshield wipers (requires a lot of mobility and possibly shearing forces in the lower spine).
          <br />The B rank has the following erercises: the dead bug (good for the lower spine but possibly too easy for intermediate and advanced athletes),
          mountain climbers, the basic plank (a beginner exercise but static), leg raises (require less mobility than &ldquo;toes to the bar&rdquo;),
          heel taps in a static crunch position (too easy for intermediate athletes), the candle raise,
          the Russian twist (which includes a rotational components and can be made harder by doing it with the legs off the ground).
          the dragon flag and the roll-out.
          <br />The A rank has the following exercises: the long lever plank (puts less pressure on shoulders and elbows than the roll-out),
          (hanging) knee raises, side plan raise (good for targeting the obliques) and the reverse crunch.
          <br />The S rank has just one exercise: the hollow body crunch.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Men's Health</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 27.11.2018).
          <br />Luke Zocchi, Chris Hemsworth's personal trainer, explains the workout he designed for Hemsworth for the film <i>Men in Black: Internationalk</i> (2019).
          The workout was designed to achieve a less bulky look than Thor and to be doable while travelling, so it involves only bodyweight and a pair of dumbbells.
          <!--1:30-->It starts with a warm-up that involves bear crawls (10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds) and
          bodyweight squats (also 10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds).
          <!--2:32-->The other exercises are weighted burpee (8 reps), curl to press (8 reps), goblet squats (8 reps), standing triceps extensions (8 reps), reverse lunge curls (8 reps),
          a shoulder excercise that cycles through a lateral raise, a front raise and an upright row (8 reps), and three plank variations:
          plank punches (8 reps), plank pulses (8 reps) and plank pikes (8 reps).
          This set of exercises are done in a cycle for thirty minutes.
          <br /><strong>Warning</strong>: Skip or replace the upright rows in the shoulder exercise;
          the upright row demonstrated in this video raises the elbows above shoulder level, which brings your shoulders into internal rotation,
          and this can be harmful to the shoulder joints.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFhg0ZQXIDA">How Much Walking To Get To 10% Body Fat (My Walking Routine)</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Mario Tomic</i> on YouTube, 7 minutes, 30.11.2020).
          <br />Walking more worked best for Mario Tomic when combined with resistance training.
          For him, it required 10.000 to 15.000 steps per day, which resulted in 300 calories burnt net per day
          (<em>net</em> calories refers to the amount of calories burnt by walking minus the amount of calories one would burn while sitting down).
          He combined this with a caloric deficit in his nutrition (below 2000 calories per day), resulting in a loss of 1.5 pounds per week.
          He did most of the walking (two thirds) after the workout, in order not to lose too much energy for the workout.
          <br />In order to find out how many steps you need to walk, you should first identify a baseline: how many steps you have been doing before.
          It you have been doing around 4.000 steps per day, you should set your initial goal to 7.000 or 8.000 and increase your average later.
          You should make the walking part of your schedule. It is also helpful to set up trackers that alert you when you miss your goal.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Vox</i> on YouTube, 5 minutes, 29.06.2016).
          <br />The greatest share of calories you burn is the result of your resting metabolism.
          The resting metabolism may even decrease when you lose weight.
          Exercise is best seen as a healthy supplement to a strategy that focuses on food.
          Unfortunately, exercise is often sold as the solution for weight loss.
          Losing weight through exercise only is much harder than losing weight through a healthy diet.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 10 minutes, 01.09.2017).
          <br />In this video, Alan Roberts explains that intermittent fasting is not a magic formula.
          It is just an eating schedule that helps you reduce your calorie intake.
          Intermittent fasting may increase growth hormone production, but its success depends on other factors.
          For example, your nutrition needs to be on point and you need to get enough sleep.
          <br />Intermittent fasting can sometimes be a matter of convenience, for example, skipping breakfast because you don't wake up hungry in the morning (like Alan Roberts).
          Alan Roberts explains how intermittent fasting fits into his own schedule. He drinks a lot of water in the hours before his first meal, which will contain a lot of protein.
          He eats half a cup of walnuts everyday, which are a good source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. (Sushi also fits into his nutrition plan.)
          <br />The most important thing is to be on a nutritional plan that meets your nutritional goals (maintenance level, gaining weight or cutting).
          There is no need to overcomplicate intermittent-fasting protocols.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 4 minutes, 25.07.2018).
          <br />Alan Roberts often says that a pound of fat corresponds with 3500 calories. The number varies a bit.
          Research has shown that there are between 8.7 and 9.5 calories in a gram of pure fat, and 9 calories is the generally accepted mean.
          However, body fat is not pure fat because it also contains fluids, proteins and other things.
          According to research 87% of body fat cells are pure fat. A simple calculation woud arrive at 3554 calories for a pound of fat, which is rounded down to 3500.
          (There are 454 grams in a pound, so 9 * 454 * 0.87 = 4086 * 0.87 = 3554.)
          <br />(For those using <abbr>SI</abbr> units: there are around 7830 calories in a kilogram of fat.)

          (<i class="ytchannel">Troy Adashun</i> on YouTube, 10 minutes, 30.07.2017).
          <br />First, getting shredded involves using intensity techniques such as <abbr title="fascia strech training 7">FST-7</abbr>, drop sets, supersets, German volume training).
          Strebl uses a rep range of 8 to 15 and, instead of measuring rest time, takes five deep breaths between sets. (Shortening rest times helps burn fat while building muscle.)
          In addition, he focuses on really relaxing his body between sets.
          Second, he has three leg days per seven days, training some of the biggest muscles in his body several times per week: quads on Tuesdays, hamstrings on Wednesdays and glutes on Thurdays.
          Third, for each muscle group he regularly uses a very high rep range, <abbr>i.e.<abbr> 30 to 50 reps per set
          Sometimes he even starts his workout with high-rep-range sets, followed by compound exercises.
          <!--@@5:53: actual workout plans -->
          <!--6:20-->According to Strebl, his diet represents 70&ndash;80 of his total results.
          For his lowest body fat percentage, he uses carb cycling in a four-day cycle: on days 1&ndash;3, he takes in 150&ndash;200 grams of carbohydrates, and on day 4 he takes in 300&ndash;400 grams of carbs.

          <br />Troy Adashun has reached 7% body fat for a few weeks during several summers and explains that getting shredded has its dark sides.
          First, you need to diet for a long time, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 8&ndash;12 weeks, to reach around 7% body fat. (You can have very visible abs at 10&ndash;12% body fat.
          (Troy does not say what body fat percentage he assumes as a starting point.) This involves resisting hunger.
          <!--4:18-->Second, the dieting and hunger causes mood swings. The lower body fat percentage also causes higher testosterone levels compared to at around 14&ndash;15% body fat.
          When you go to 5% fat, you will lower your testosterone level.
          <!--6:01-->Third, you will experience strong craving, especially at night. (Counting macros when you are eating out is very difficult.)
          <!--8:59-->Fourth, you will find it very difficult to make strength gains and lean muscle gains (on the way from 10% to 7% body fat).
          <!--10:55-->Fifth, your best friends will become vegetables, high-volume foods and stimulants. (This type of diet may not very very healthy.)
          <!--15:28-->Finally,  you may very lethargic and low on energy. Some people already experience this at 9&ndash;10% body fat.
          You may have a lot of cortisol in your body, which is not healthy.

          is starting with the overhead press, moving through to the incline press and then through to the flat bench.
          See the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTLlRBdFbIw">High-Performance Mass Program: Upper Body Pressing - Program Overview</a>
          <!--1:41-->(<i class="ytchannel">Testosterone Nation</i>, 7 minutes, 24.10.2014), in which Christian Thibaudeau makes exactly this recommendation.
          (Thibaudeau points out that your benchpress will initially decline, but increase again later.)
          James also talks about agonist-antagonis workouts. Changes in workouts don't need to be massive.
          <br /><!--12:25-->However, PewDiePie's message about training to failure over-simplifies this topic.
          For example, a beginner should not lift to failure, not only for safety reasons but also to imprive their technique.
          James referst to the paper <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-scj/Abstract/2019/10000/Does_Training_to_Failure_Maximize_Muscle.14.aspx">Does Training to Failure Maximize Muscle Hypertrophy?</a>

          The waist should be measured an inch above the belly button.

          <br />10,000 steps per day is quite a lot; it takes roughly 2 hours. The number was first presented in 1964 as part of a marketing campaign,
          it was not a scientifically researched number. A lack of exercise has many downsides, but how much is sufficient?
          A study found that 4,400 steps per day significantly increased life expectancy in women. This benefit increased up to 7,500 steps per day;
          more than 7,5OO had no additional effect.
          <br />Recommendations from doctors vary widely; on average, they recommend at least 4 hours of exercise per week: 2.5 hours of low-intensity exercise
          (for example, walking) and 1.5 hours with a higher intensity. More is better.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Tone and Tighten</i> on YouTube, 8 minutes, 21.01.2021).
          <br />Knee pain can be caused by weak hip abductors. You can do two tests for hip abductor weakness: the Trendelenburg test and the squat or lunge test.
          If you find out that your hips are weak, you can go through four exercises. The first is sidelying hip abduction (3 sets of 15&ndash;20 reps).
          The scond exercise is a resisted hip abduction (3 sets of 15&ndash;20 reps). The third exercise is lateral band walks (3 sets of 15&ndash;20 reps).
          The fourth exercise is a side plank with hip abduction (3 sets of 10&ndash;15 reps).
