  <h2>Introduction (or Warning)</h2>
  <p>The dates in the chronology are based on the 
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian calendar</a></strong>
    that was in use in Shakespeare's time, and which was not replaced with the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>
    until the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750">Calendar (New Style) Act 1750</a>.
    Due to the differences between these two calendars, Shakespeare's birthday is currently celebrated on the wrong day.

        Since there are no records about Shakespeare's date of birth

        Shakespeare's birthday is celebrated on the wrong day. The correct date appears to be 3 May.
