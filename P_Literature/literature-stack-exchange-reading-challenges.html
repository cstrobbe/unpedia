      <h2 id="challenges-background">Background on Reading Challenges</h2>
      <p>The monthly topic challenges are a result of the feedback on the question
        <a href="https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/571/do-we-want-something-akin-to-topic-challenges-for-books-outside-our-bailiwick-t">Do we want something akin to topic challenges for books outside our bailiwick, to help alleviate the book diversity problem?</a>
        The outcome was overwhelmingly positive.
        Some other sites run weekly topic challenges, as described on Meta Stack Exchange:
        <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/240634/how-do-weekly-topic-challenges-work">How do weekly topic challenges work?</a>
        However, due to the time it takes to read a book (added to the time it takes to borrow it from a library or to buy it), weekly topic challenges would be too short.
        <a href="https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/596/2191">Suggest your Lit.SE reading challenges here!</a>
        is the old meta post where participants can submit new proposals for monthly challenges.
        <a href="https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1172/2191">Monthly Topic Challenges aren't getting much attention. How can we change them?</a>
        is a meta post from July 2019 asking for proposals to increase contributions to the monthly challenges.
        As a result of this, the reading challenges were changed (see below) and the meta post
        <a href="https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1238/2191">New Literature SE Topic Challenge Suggestions Thread</a>
        was created in April 2020 to replace the old meta post.
      </p>
      <p>There were no reading challenges in December 2017, January 2018, August 2019, September 2019 and December 2019.
        For each topic challenge, the number of questions, answers, views, participants and votes refer to the activity during the topic challenge.
        Answers, votes, views etcetera that were submitted later don't count,
        even though it would be interesting to see which topic remained &ldquo;popular&rdquo; after the topic challenge.
      </p>
      <p>There were no reading challenges in August and September 2019. Due to low participation in the preceding months,
        the reading challenges were revised based on a
        <a href="https://literature.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1175/2191">proposal that each reading challenge would run for two months</a>,
        that the next reading challenge would be announced one month in advance and that a new challenge would be started each month,
        so there would always be two reading challenges running concurrently.

          <br />From the publisher's book description:
          <q>The first book of long fiction by an African to be published in English, this novel tells the story of a young woman of the Vai people in Liberia. Guanya Pau, betrothed as a child to a much older, polygamous man, flees her home rather than be forced into marriage, and the novel recounts her subsequent efforts to reach the Christian community where the man she loves awaits her.
          Joseph Jeffrey Walters was a Vai man who converted to Christianity, and this, his only novel, is a remarkably complex work, embracing both Christian beliefs and a deep pride in his African heritage.</q>

    Ursula Le Guin:
      Gareth Rees: "The Left Hand of Darkness was a hugely influential science fiction novel about gender; if it doesn't have the same effect now then that's because everyone writing about gender in sf has been influenced by Le Guin." The Left Hand of Darkness was a hugely influential science fiction novel about gender; if it doesn't have the same effect now then that's because everyone writing about gender in sf has been influenced by Le Guin.
        "My personal favourite is Always Coming Home which is a kind of anthropological study of a fictional society in post-apocalypse California. (Le Guin's parents were anthropologists). But it won't suit every reader."
        "The Hainish novels don't have a continuous narrative and can be read in any order. They get more sophisticated as Le Guin matures as a writer, so there is nothing to be lost by starting with the later ones. Which one will suit you best probably depends on your interests: The Left Hand of Darkness is about gender; The Dispossessed political–economic sociology; and The Telling colonialism."
        "The "Earthsea" novels, by contrast, do have a continuous narrative so you should start at the beginning." https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/44404278#44404278 
    Feminism in SF: "There's an important subgenre of feminist sf, including utopias (Piercy, Woman on the Edge of Time), separatism (Griffith, Ammonite), satire (Russ, We Who Are About to ...), techology/gender relations (Bujold, Ethan of Athos) and so on. Le Guin was an influential writer in this tradition." https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/44404435#44404435

      1.Is Girard correct that all hierarchies and divisions within Thebes have broken down in Sophocles’ Oedipus?
      2.Is Sophocles’ Oedipus a Girardian scapegoat for the city of Thebes?
      3.Does Girard’s theory of scapegoating have relevance to Seneca’s play?
      4.Had something occurred in Seneca’s Thebes that has abolished distinctions and degrees and led to the decay of society in the manner Girard envisions?

    * W. Wordsworth: "Glen-Almain" (The Major Works: 312f): Did Wordsworth think James Macpherson's Ossian translations were authentic?
    * Was Rosemary Sutcliff's The High Deeds of Finn MacCool (1967) influenced by James Macpherson's Ossian translations?
      In 1967, Rosemary Sutcliff published the children's novel [*The High Deeds of Finn MacCool*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Deeds_of_Finn_MacCool),
      which is a retelling of the stories of the Irish hunter-warrior [Fionn mac Cumhaill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fionn_mac_Cumhaill)
      and the [Fenian Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenian_Cycle).
      The stories around Fionn mac Cumhaill or Finn McCool have also been used in one of the most famous literary forgeries in English literature:
      the [Ossian poems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossian) published by [James Macpherson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Macpherson)
      in the 1760s.
      The fact that these publications were exposed as forgeries does not imply that they can't be used as a source of inspiration.
      So is there any evidence that Rosemary Sutcliff used James Macpherson's publications as a source?
    * How many copies of a single play could be printed in a single printrun in late 16th-century England?
      See Eugene Giddens: How to Read a Shakespearean Play Text. page 49:
      > In 1586 the Star Chamber limited the number of copies that might be printed from one setting of type to 1250 to 1500.
      Elsewhere I had read that the maximum number was 1000 (i.e. for the First Folio).
      Did the number vary by genre or another criterium? What was the actual limit for a single play?

    * In what way could attending university during the English Renaissance turn you into a good writer?
      One of the arguments against the conventional wisdom that William Shakespeare from Stratford wrote the plays that are attributed to him is the fact that he did not atttend university. Some of the [87 (!) alternative Shakespeare authorship candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Shakespeare_authorship_candidates) did attend university, e.g. Christopher Marlowe, bishop [Lancelot Andrewes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancelot_Andrewes), [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon), [Samuel Daniel)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Daniel), [Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Vere,_17th_Earl_of_Oxford), the poet and cleric [John Donne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donne), the playwright and polemicist [Robert Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Greene_(dramatist)), member of the [University Wits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Wits) (which also included Marlowe), the playwright [Thomas Heywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Heywood), the physician [Thomas Lodge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lodge) and [Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sackville,_1st_Earl_of_Dorset). (Those who question Shakespeare's authorship are known as anti-Stratfordians. Some anti-Stratfordians even claim that [Shakespeare had little or no education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_authorship_question#Education_and_literacy). For the sake of this question, I will simply assume that Shakespeare attended grammar school but not university.)
      One of the implications of the university-education argument is that such an education increased one's chances of becoming a "good" writer; i.e. there is something about university education during the English renaissance that provided the right foundations for people who wanted to write.

    * How can I learn to read literature written in older varieties of English (Shakespeare, Chaucer, Beowulf)?
      Assuming you wish to do this systematically, there are three approaches:
      1. Start from modern literature and gradually move back through the history of English literature to gradually adapt to the older varieties of the English language.
      2. Start from the earlier stage not older than Middle English, but read the older text and a translation side by side, or a thoroughly annotated edition.
      3. More academically: read books on the grammar and possibly the vocabulary of the older variety of English in which you want to read.
        This is hard to avoid if you want to read Old English (Beowulf), i.e. the variety of English used before the Norman conquest in 1066.
        Examples of helpful books - Old English, MIddle English, Early Modern English. After Early Modern English, you may not need books on grammar but good dictionaries would be helpful.

      It is a text that Boccaccio substantially reworked twice but English translators seem to prefer the first and longest version [Armstrong, 2004, page 3].
      The chapter titles found in English translations of the *Life of Dante* are an artefact of these translations; in fact, Boccaccio's text did not even have chapter divisions [Armstrong, 2004, page 3].
