          <br />This is the first video with a musical intro and the first to mention ATHLEANX.com; Athlean comes from athletic + lean.
          This  is also the first &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video. The

          <br />This is the second &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video, which assumes you have been doing the exercises from the first video for a while.
          In the introductory part of the video, Jeff stresses the importance of hydration using water instead of coffee.
          He says that you don't need cardio to strip of fat; a combination of diet and strength training should work.
          Instead of worrying about high-carb or low-carb diets, he recommends getting rid of foods that contain a lot of fats
          (sweets, chocolate, butters, cream sauces, mayo, etcetera).
          <br />He then goes on to demonstrate ab exercises that you can do every day of the week.
          (The <a href="https://youtu.be/0hU5dSlWqK8?t=208">actual exercises start at 3:28</a>.)
          The exercises are the ISO reverse crunch, &ldquo;one down, two up&rdquo;, the med ball balance crunch, the commando crunch
          and the standing tubing over twist.
          <br />In the comments, Jeff recommends doing the ab workout three times per week and gradually increasing the frequency to five times per week.

          In one of the comments, responds to someone saying that sport-specific exercises are a bit overrated:
          <blockquote>I agree with your view of "functional" exercise being overdone.  However, I define "functional" or "sports specific" as purposeful exercise.
            Exercises that have purposeful carryover to the movements that occur on the field are not only rightfully placed in an athlete's training program but necessary if you want to maximize performance.
            This and other exercises I recommend are based on real world results with some of the top players in <abbr>MLB</abbr>.

          <br />This is the third &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.<!--Mentions that the weather is getting nice in Connecticut, which provides excuses for not working out.-->
          <!--1:58-->Jeff points out that the workouts he describes take only ten minutes, so it should be feasible to fit into your schedule.
          The exercises that Jeff demonstrates are &ldquo;Plate Eight&rdquo;, the Recline Press Crunch, the Side Pillar Twist (also known as Side Plank Rotations),
          the Physioball Rollout and the Physioball Skier Tucks.

          <br />(Video in the series &ldquo;Major League Insider Training&rdquo;.)
          This video demonstrates an exercise called &ldquo;pitcher's curl and crunch&rdquo;, with a rope attached to a high cable machine.

          <br />This is the fourth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          This episode focuses more on speed: you don't need to do a thousand crunches if you slow down the tempo.
          Jeff advises to not only copy his exercises but his tempo as well. He then demonstrates the following exercises:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets of 10 reps), tubing punch and crunch (2 sets of 12 reps each side),
          V-up slow twists (using a medicine ball, 2 sets of 10-12 reps),
          medicine ball &ldquo;2 1 &rdquo; (2 sets of 21 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 3-way x 7) and
          rolling planks (2 sets of 12 complete rolls).

          <br />This is the fifth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          Jeff demonstrates a new set of more difficult exercises:
          mad ball plank switches (2 sets of 12 switches each side, using a medicine ball that is small enough so you can grab it using a single hand),
          med ball cross knee tuck (2 sets of 10 to each side),
          figure eights (2 sets of 8 to 10 eights),
          tubing Russian twists (2 sets of 15 reps to each side) and
          physioball running man (2 sets of 12 reps each leg).
          <br />In the second half of the video, Jeff answers a question about nutrition, more particularly cheat meals.
          He says, <q cite="https://youtu.be/EGdCC1Jomgw?t=176">If you stay away from that stuff long enough, you'll start to lose your cravings for it</q>.
          In addition, seeing your gains may increase your willpower to stay away from cheat meals.
          <!--3:25-->If you eat five times per day, as Jeff recommends, totalling 35 meals per week, you can be a little free in what you eat five times.
          However, it is better to consistently eat healthy food.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9p6Nwmc6Nw">Insider Training Blog Episode I - Upper Body Dynamic Warmup</a> (6 minutes, 19.05.2009).
          <br />Jeff answers a question from a baseballer player about warming up the upper body.

          <br />In episode 6 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;,  Jeff first discusses supplements. He points out that many supplements available on the market
          are not good for your health; these include fat burning pills. Instead, you should rev up you metabolism by eating five to six times a day and spreading these meals two to three hours apart.
          However, since eating five to six times per day can be difficult, protein bars and protein shakes can come in handy. Some
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid">fatty acids</a> (omega-3) and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine">creatine</a> (if you drink enough water) can also be good.
          <br />The ab exercises<!--2:05--> he demonstrates are the following:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets until failure), hanging corkscrews (2 sets until failure),
          hanging &ldquo;around the clocks&rdquo; (2 sets until failure), pretzel reverse crunches (2 sets of 15 on each leg; no rest between switching legs) and
          physioball plank marches (2 sets of 12-15 marches for each leg per set).

          <br />In episode 7 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;,  Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:
          tubing forklifts (2 sets of 12-15 reps), dumbbell punch and crunch (2 sets of 15 reps on each arm),
          physioball wall crunch (2 sets of 21 reps), rolling jackknifes (2 sets of 15 reps for each leg) and
          sleeping bat crunches (2 sets of 12-15 reps).
          <br />(As in previous videos in this series, there is no guidance on rest times between sets.)

          <br />This video presents a few variations to make the plank exercise more challenging.
          In the first variation, he recommends supporting yourself on your hands instead of on your elbows.
          In the second variation, he puts his feet on a bench.
          In the third variation, he recommends narrowing the base of support, both for the hands and the feet.
          In the final variation, he combines some of the previous principles.

          <br />Planks is a good exercise but only for those who find it challenging, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> those who can't hold it more than a minute.
          Jeff proposes alternatives that involve rotation and rely solely on body weight.

          <br />This video explains a few weaknesses of the plank exercise and clears up a few mistunderstandings about it (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> benefits for the glutes and posture).
          Near the end of the video, he demonstrates a reverse plank that actually activates the glutes and the interscapular muscles.

          <br />Jesse explains he did the Baby Shark ab challenge for thirty days, which resulted in washboard abs (an eightpack according to Jesse).
          Jeff is sceptical.
          <a href="https://youtu.be/M4aPUBgmG_o?t=137">Jesse demonstrates the baby shark workout</a>.
          Jeff then highlights the positive aspects of the thirty-day challenge: first, consistency: abs should be trained daily;
          <!--4:00-->second, constant tension during the entire exercise; third, the workout uses time as a training variable instead of reps.
          <!--4:36-->Jesse adds that this is a short workout; if it isn't hard enough, you can just repeat it.
          <!--4:53-->As a fourth benefit, Jeff points out that it is easier to train to music; the music may distract you from the burn you feel in your muscles.
          <!--5:11-->However, Jeff also adds that Jesse could have chosen a workout from the Six Pack Promise from ATHLEAN-X (available as an app in the app store).

          <br />Just like the triceps contributes a lot to the volume of the upper arm, the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachioradialis">brachioradialis</a>
          contributes a lot to the volume of the forearm. Jeff uses his muscle markers to show where the brachioradialis
          attaches to the humerus and the radius. Unlike true forearm muscles, the brachioradialis has no action on the wrist.
          <br /><!--2:10-->This leads to the question in what position the forearm should be in order to train this muscle: supinated, neutral or pronated?
          In a supinated position, the biceps does the work of flexing the elbow.<!--2:33--> In a neutral grip position the brachioradialis gets also activated.
          <!--2:47-->However, the brachioradialis can also pronate the forearm, so in order to train the muscle, we need both pronation and flexion.
          <br /><!--3:45-->The first exercise you can do is <strong>reverse barbell curls</strong>,
          using either a straight bar with a lower weight (fully pronated position of the forearm)
          or an EZ bar, which brings the wrists a bit closer to a neutral position, which also allows you to use more weight.
          <br /><!--4:39-->The second exercise you can do is the <strong>reverse lat pull down</strong> (towards and past the head).
          <!--5:30-->Instead of the bar, you can also use the ropes you otherwise use for face pulls.
          <br /><!--5:57-->The third exercise you can do is <strong>battle ropes</strong> using a neutral or a pronated grip.
          <br /><!--6:50-->The fourth exercise you can do is <strong>biceps curls</strong> in which you grip the dumbbells close to the plates in the middle of the body
          and then curl while at the same time turning the forearm into a pronated position.
          <br /><!--7:49-->Finally, putting plates back after you're done with an exercise also activates the brachioradialis and is good gym etiquette.

      - "TOP 5 WORST EXERCISES (Stop Doing These!!)", 11 minutes, 17.04.2014: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6Y3WDY1tUo
        Jeff Cavaliere judges exercises based on their risks-to-benefits ratio.
        - 1:22: chest flys: at the bottom of the movement, the exercise no longer stretches the chest but the coracobrachialis; going too far down can cause a torn pec.
          2:41: alterative: cable cross over (standing)
        - 2:51: behind-the-neck should press involves pushing in an abnormal plane of motion, which increases the risk of impingement. Alternative exercises have the elbows in front of your body.
        - 5:08: upright rows pushes the shoulders into an impingement position.
        - 6:36: good mornings

      - "Calisthenics Workouts: Pros and Cons (TOP 4!)", 9 minutes, 11.03.2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAJXkAOlnqM
        Pros: (1) It is inexpensive, since you don't need to pay for equipment or a gym membership.
        (2) You can do bodyweight exercises anywhere; (3) bodyweight exercises are typically more athletic because they are compound movements (whereas exercises involving weights tend to isolate muscles).
        (4) Bodyweight exercises are good for conditioning and fat loss (compound movement allow you to burn more body fat).
        4:29: Cons: (1) Bodyweight exercises are not necessarily the best fit if you are trying to train around in injury, since it is harder to isolate specific joints etc.
        (2) Bodyweight exercises require more co-ordination (however, this can be trained also).
        (3) It is harder to progress, unless you understand very well how your body is moving, while you can easily add weight to a bar to make progress. this can cause you to plateau.
        (4) It is a myth that you can't use bodyweight exercises to build muscle or to get strong, but you need to know how to do it.

      - "Do This BEFORE Every Workout! (Guaranteed Gains)", 7 minutes, 16.05.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veXVvjc9_EA
        This video is not about a secret exercise but about being aware of your own efforts and not taking sets or reps off.
        "I think that many of us simply get comfortable in our workouts.  We start to call them workout routines.
        Nothing should be routine about your training other than the fact that you routinely show up to perform them.
        When it comes to your intensity levels however when doing your workouts I would bet that you are likely falling a little short in that department."
        "Regardless, the key is that you become self aware of your own efforts before every workout that you do.
        Once you know that you can likely fall into the trap of taking sets and reps off then you will be more likely to intervene and not do this."

      - "Body Fat for Abs to Show - The Truth! (MEN AND WOMEN)", 8 minutes, 09.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wqXNZbnZEs
        There is a range of body fat percentages at which your abs can become visible, even up to 19% body fat for men and 23% for women.
        You need to determine the body fat percentage that you are starting from and what level if visibility (or body fat) you want to achieve.
        You can then calculate approximately how long it should take to achieve your goal.
        If you choose to achieve your goal through a combination of nutrition and training, Jeff recommends a method that involves
        a caloric deficit of 500 calories per day through nutrition cuts and an additional 250 calorie deficit through training.
        This should result in a weight loss of 1.5 lbs (or 0.68 kilo) per week.
        (Jeff uses the example of a person weighing 200 lbs or 91 kilogram and 30% body fat at the start who needs to lose 40 lbs to reach 10% body fat.) 
      - "How to Get Bigger Legs Fast (QUARTER SQUATS!)", 7 minutes, 13.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cczwdE88FyY
        There is value to quarter squats. It is an exercise that focuses on the top range of motion, where you are strongest, just like the pin press or a mat-elevanted deadlift.
        The quarter squat can be beneficial for vertical jump height compared to the half squat and the full squat, according to a study published on PubMed.
        The downside was a loss in 40-yard sprint times.
        When doing quarter squats, you need to follow three rules: (1) you need to hinge from the hips and bend the knees,
        (2) quarter squats don't count towards personal records, and (3) you need to be willing to load the barbell more heavily then for a regular squat.
        In addition, the quarter squat should be used as a complement to the full squat, not as a replacement.
        There is also a variation of the quarter squat that is not performed at the top of the range of motion but at the bottom.
        This exercises trains the legs in their weaker range.

  * "Bodybuilding Supplements Video - The SCARY TRUTH", 10 minutes, 10.02.2013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfM_QBYNFs
    - Some supplememnts contain magnesium stearate, which is just added to prevent ingredients from sticking to machinery and which your body does not need.
    - Not every gram of protein in a product will actually be absorbed by the body.
    - Stores that sell supplements are often incentivised by a manufacturer to recommend the manufacturer's products, not to tell you what is best for you.
    - Some pre-workout products contain 1,3-dimethylamylamine (dmaa), which should be banned because it is not healthy. (WebMD: https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1258/1-3-dmaa)
    - Nutrition comes first; supplementation makes no sense if your nutrition sucks.
