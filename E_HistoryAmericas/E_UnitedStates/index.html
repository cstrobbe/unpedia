          (<i class="ytchannel"> Late Night with Seth Meyers</i> on YouTube, 9 minutes, 22.01.2021).
          <br />This interview is not only about the mittens but also about his expectations about Biden's government.
          (He does not see how Democrats can reach out to White Supremacists.)
          He says that the Democrats should pass legislation by simply majority vote instead of reaching out indefinitely to Republicans;
          there is a lot of legislation that can be passed with just 51 Democratic votes in the Senate.
          The impeachment will be an impediment to some degree but it must be done because inciting an insurrection is unacceptable.
          The <abbr>USA</abbr> has serious issues to deal with, such as the Corona pandemic, people at risk of getting evicted and climate change,
          but he thinks the country can make progress on these issues and in the impeachement simultaneously.

          <br />This is an interview with Jon Favreau. Favreau thinks McConnell will eventually back down instead of filibustering and blocking a power-sharing agreement with Chuck Shumer.
          If necessary the 50 Democratic senators combined with the Vice President's tie-breaking vote could put an agreemnt in place that is to Chuck Shumer's liking.
          Favreau thinks the Democrative caucus is more united than the Republican caucus, so McConnell's position may not be as strong as he imagines.
          (Biden and Shumer seem to be willing to get rid of the filibuster; some Democrats, Joe Manchin and possibly a few others, appear to oppose it.)
          Other topics of the interview are the budget reconciliation bill (and how raising the minimum wage may fit into it), measures for Covid relief,
          <abbr>OAN</abbr> and Newsmax credentials for the White House press room (Favreaut thinks they shouldn't get credentials) and
          the mainstream media not being liberal (because the prioritise &ldquo;balance&rdquo; over truth).

          (<i class="ytchannel">Amanda Robertson</i> on YouTube, 7 minutes, 07.03.2019).
          <br />Description:
          <q>Sanders in 1981 defeated Gordon Paquette, Burlington’s five-term Democratic mayor, by just 10 votes. The then-39-year-old Sanders ran as an independent and, while he didn’t campaign as a socialist, he made no secret of it, either.
          Elected just months after Ronald Reagan was elected to the presidency, Sanders’s victory caught national attention.<br />
          The 1981 Today segment, titled “Socialism in New England,” shows journalist Jane Pauley declaring, “Face it, you don’t find too many socialists in elected office in this country.”<br />
          It then cuts to Phil Donahue, who is sitting down with the newly-elected Sanders. He says that many people were surprised at Sanders’s narrow win. “My goodness, how could this happen in good old conservative Vermont?” Donahue asked.<br />
          “Well, in Vermont, being conservative is different, perhaps, than being conservative elsewhere in the country,” Sanders said.</q>

          (<i class="ytchannel">The Humanist Report</i> on YouTube, 5 minutes, 07.07.2015).
          <br />For example, in the 1970s Sanders, as a candidate for governor of Vermont, wrote in a letter,
          <q>Let's abolish all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, secual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, <abbr>etc</abbr>.).</q>
          As mayor of Burlington, he defended the right of gays and lesbians to have a Gay Pride Day in 1983.
