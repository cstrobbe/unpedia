          for example the video
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYnx49pTqhc">Doug McGuff, <abbr>MD</abbr> on The Best Routine, Frequency of Training and Recovery for the Over-40s | <abbr>HI</abbr>Tuni</a>
          (5 minutes, 21.05.2018).
          This is about exercises that are chosen to that most of the concentration is focused on effort instead of co-ordination.
          This results in the following types of exercises:
          (1) an upper-body push in the horizontal plane, (2) an upper-body pull in the horizontal plane, (3) an upper-body push in the vertical plane, (4) an upper-body pull in the vertical plane and (5) a pressing movement with the lower body.
          You may also want a hinging movement around the hips, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> some sort of lumbar extension or a Roman chair extension, superman on the floor or even a deadlift.
          <br />These big body movements will cover most of the musculature throughout the body.
          In the beginning, you can start Monday-Wednesday-Friday and after a few days move to a Monday-Thursday frequency. If you are feeling fatigued, you can change that to Monday-Friday-Wednesday.
          Improvements don't necessarily follow the pattern workout-recovery-improvement; sometimes it follows the pattern of a few workout-recovery cycles before improvement can be seen.
          In one of the comments, HiTuni / Doug McGuff explains what the big five exercises are:
          <ul>
            <li>a lower body push, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> leg press or squat,</li>
            <li>an upper body horizontal pull, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a multi-joint row,</li>
            <li>an upper body horizontal push, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a chest press or bench press,</li>
            <li>an upper body vertical pull, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a pulldown or chin-up.</li>
          </ul>
          Doug McGuff also answers a number of questions in the comments:
          <dl class="q-a-list">
            <dt class="question">I always hear people talk about protein synthesis and that after 48 hours your muscles stop growing and you should hit them again. But in my opinion your muscles don't start growing until their repaired.</dt>
              <dd class="answer">Muscles also don't suddenly start atrophying just because protein synthesis has returned to baseline. Just looking at protein synthesis is too narrow of a perspective.</dd>
            <dt class="question">(&hellip;) I will do a HIT routine, train to failure on all major muscle groups, but I am putting on top of that some follow up exercise because I worry that maybe I didn't really train to failure.
            I will usually try another round or two of hit later in the day, either with fewer reps top failure or with a lower weight. The maybe some isolation exercises like dumbel curls to failure. Also some negatives. (&hellip;)</dt>
              <dd class="answer">2x <abbr>HIT</abbr> workouts per week is enough resistance training, adding more will likely hinder rather than help results- and can lead to that wiped out feeling you describe. Focus on getting good at going to momentary muscular failure safely and you will have done what needs to be done!</dd>
            <dt class="question">What other workouts is he doing besides Big 5?? I can’t find anything anywhere on cardio recommendations. Is he walking? Jogging?</dt>
              <dd class="answer">As Childish Gamebino mentioned the "cardio" is in the workout. The metabolic impact of performing sets to momentary failure is akin to sprinting. Being physically active, walking etc. between HIT workouts is a good thing,
              but there is no need for a formal schedule- just be spontaneously active!</dd>

              German volume training involves doing 10 sets of 10 reps for each exercise.

            - "The BIGGEST Gym Mistake: INTENSITY !", 11 minutes, 07.04.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDAFAokr2RU
              You need to look at your muscle fiber dominance (type 1 or type 2).
              Those with a higher type-2-muscle fiber dominance will benefit from low-volume work, whereas type-1-dominant people will benefit from high-volume work.
              In addition the more training experience you have, the higher your intensity needs to be.
              You should use a multitude of rep ranges for hypertrophy. See Charles Poliquin (Principles) and Brad Schoenfeld.
              See also Christian Thibaudeau.
            - "The FIVE Biggest Gym MISTAKES To Avoid", 8 minutes, 01.07.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h4_evTbyQg
              1. Too many isolation exercises at the cost of compound movements.
              2. Taking your fitness advice from an influencer just because they are "successful". Or applying information from an elite bodybuilder to yourself without understanding why they do what they do.
              3. Training frequency: @@
              4. 3.40: Not timing rest periods.
              5. 5:04: No planned periodisation. You need to a changing stimulus and progressive overload. (See other video about periodisation.)
            - "Vince Del Monte vs. Shredded Sports Science", 11 minutes, 10.10.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSQaNl8cQWQ
              A few facts that Vince Del Monte was not aware of:
              e.g. [1:50] <q>The energy sources that your body uses are highly related to the intensity of training: low-intensity training will use more fat for fuel (...) and high-intensity training will use more glycogen."
              [6:33] There is a difference between lean mass and muscle mass. There is also difference between contractile and non-contractile hypertrophy.
              [See Greg Nuckols: "Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy: The Bros Were Probably Right", 17.12.2015: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/sarcoplasmic-vs-myofibrillar-hypertrophy/ ]
            - "Ashley Nocera is on a Journey To Snap City", 7 minutes, 30.04.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LOKKib2ENE
              Some of the exercises in Ashley Nocera's video can lead to injury.
            - "Can You Build Muscle With Calisthenics ONLY ?", 11 minutes, 19.05.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGCcsSNLVAQ
              Yes, you can. "You need to incorporate the base layer principles of muscle hypertrophy, focusing on progressive overload in your training and a positive energy balance or caloric surplus with your nutrition."
              Targeting some specific muscles can be difficult without weights.
              It is a good idea to use weights or machines to target, for example, the posterior chain and the rotator cuffs (face pulls).
            - "'Functional Fitness' Needs FIXING", 11 minutes, 26.05.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJArIiopiBw
              Functional training is a spectrum that depends on you and your characteristics.
            - "Are MUSCLE UPS Just A PARTY TRICK ?", 8 minutes, 02.06.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vWgA4eR7nc
              YouTube has many videos about how to do muscle ups, but very few that discuss the risks versus benefits.
              There are different types of muscle ups, e.g. pure strength based muscle ups and momentum-based muscle ups.
            - "Six Pack Machine STUPIDITY", 10 minutes, 23.07.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOd-SqZAGx0
              This video debunks so-called abs machines that are sold as devices that give you a six pack using electric stimulation (EMS).

            - "THIS MAN is the Insta Virus Star", 10 minutes, 27.09.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3rLzJBe-OI
              Bradley Martyn  is a legitimate power lifter, but he has started putting out videos showing ridiculous and even dangerous "exercices" (especially on Instagram).
            - "Functional Fitness Has FAILED YOU (Naudi Aguilar/ Barbell Backflip)", 11 minutes, 23.10.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0mObDcg0ck
              Exercises that involve multiple planes of motion are usually functional, but that does not mean that everything else is not functional.
              The fitness world should stop being so binary about functional training, since it is difficult to not classify an exercise as functional.
              Too many people demonstrate or promote exercises that are simply dangerous but which they sell as "functional", e.g. performing squats on a BOSU ball or doing backflips with a barbell.
            - "Is Scott Herman's Schoenfeld Critique Correct ?", 11 minutes, 25.11.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jermh2fUz7E
              Scott Herman claimed that there are mus-do exercises, disagreeing or misreading an Instagram post by Dr. Brad Schoenfeld.
            - "Fitness SELLOUTS and Superset SCIENCE", 10 minutes, 17.01.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlHqbQbUZbY
              The targets this time are Jack Owoc (Bang Energy CEO) Jillian Michaels and Jim Stoppani.
              3:42: The second part of the video discusses supersets. Their main benefit is efficiency: you do more in less time.
              There are various ways in which you can do them, i.e. with regard when you have resting periods.
              4:50: If your goal is hypertrophy, then supersets are worth considering. However, if your goal is performance related, for example power or velocity, then supersets are not recommended.
              [Cf. Weakley et al: The Effects of Superset configuration on Kinetic, Kinematic, and Perceived Exertion in the Barbell Bench Press. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, August 2017
              Cf. Brentano et al: Muscle Damage and Muscle Activity Induced by Strength Training Super-Sets in Physically Active Men. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, July 2017]
              5:15: There are two main ways to do supersets: the agonist-antagonist method and the method that relies on relies on the same similar-biomechanical movements.
              An example of an agonist-antagonist superset would involve a barbell benchpress and a backrow, whereas the barbell benchpress and pushups would involve the similar-biomechanical movements.
              An advantage of the first method is that it includes recovery during the session.
            - "HOLLYWOOD Does Fitness", 10 minutes, 19.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOGif6OfbHg
              Well, sort of. Celebrity workouts are just like other workouts, actually. Don't expect to end up looking just like the celebrity you are imitating.
              According to one &ldqou;celebrity trainer&rdquo; <q><abbr>HIIT</abbr/> is the most powerful way to build strength and tone your body (...) [and] it's also the most effective way to target belly fat.</q>
              The man does apparently not realise that different training protocols have different outcomes. HIIT cannot hit all of these goals, i.e. strength, &dlquo;toning&rdquo; and reducing body fat.
              HIIT is not a suitable protocol for increasing strength because it involves short rest periods, while strength training involves longer rest periods.
              HIIT is not the most suitable protocol for muscle definition either, again because it involves short rest periods and is designed to keep your heart rate at a high level.
              We should also adapt our training as we age: the older we get, the more we need to focus on recovery. Resistance training should be less frequent.
              And even younger people should think about longevity.

              Doucette criticises on Eddie Hall's claim that you need to cut and bulk because you can't put on muscle while dieting.
              Someone who is using supplements and steroids loses muscle when cutting because they are at or above their genetic maximum.
              It is better to consistently remain at a body fat percentage where you feel well than to go go up and down in cycles.

              This video debunks some of the nonsense Vince Sant tells in a video about his training programme.

              (20 minutes, 24.03.2017).
              <br />Greg explains that there are several test methods, such as skinfold caliper tests, underwater weighing, a <abbr title="dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry">DXA</abbr> (or <abbr>DEXA</abbr>) scan,
              or some other type of test based on electrical conductivity of the body. <!--0:40-->However, each test is essentially a guess,
              and comparing the results of different types of tests would not lead to an accurate comparison.
              <!--0:57-->Even a skinfold caliper test is only as accurate as the person testing.
              In addition, <q cite="https://youtu.be/Lv5rcuCspk0?t=108">In general, almost everyone underestimates what percent they are. Why? Because a low number is cool.</q>
              <!--2:38-->Greg did a test based on electrical conductivity, which put him at 18% body fat, and one using the calipers, that put him at 9.8%.
              <br /><!--3:20--><strong>Women</strong> have at least 9% body fat, due to essential body fat that they need to stay alive.
              However, a bikini girl at that body fat percentage would look anorexic.
              <!--4:30-->The average bikini girl competitor at a national level would have between 13 and 18% body fat. At the provincial level, they would have 20% body fat or more.
              <!--6:55-->The average body fat percentage for women [in Canada] is 33%, which corresponds to obesity. (Greg Doucette says he has tested hundreds of people in Canada.)
              <!--7:35-->For health reasons, women should stay below 30% body fat. However, a woman with 15% body fat who is not working out probably has a nutrition problem or a physical disorder (unless the cause is genetic).
              <br /><!--9:31--><strong>Men</strong> need at least 3% body fat to stay alive. Tests that give a lower body fat percentage should be considered unreliable.
              <!--10:35-->Men participating at national-level &ldquo;physique&rdquo; competitions have between 6% and 9% body fat.
              A 6% body fat level is very hard to maintain outside competitions; it results in a very vascular and shredded look.
              <!--11:37-->Bodybuilders at nationnal-level competitions reach a body fat percentage of 4% to 6%.
              <!--13:06-->Men [in Canada] have 25% body fat on average, which also constitutes obesity. (Greg does not claim to use an exact definition of obesity in this video.)
              For health reasons, men should aim for 20% or less body fat. Leaner is better as long as you don't get too lean.
              <!--13:55-->For example, endurance athletes such as marathon runners and professional cyclists might get in the range of 5 to 7%.
              <!--14:17-->Most men who hire Greg Doucette (and are already training) have between 15% and 18% body fat.
              <br /><!--15:03-->At the end of the video, Greg gives examples of (hypothetical) people who underestimate their body fat percentage.
              He also repeats that all the tests are guesses.

              (8 minutes, 08.09.2017).
              <br />According to Greg Doucette, fasted cardio is nonsense. It became populer in the 1990s, based on the belief that it burns fat.
              <!--1:11-->However, training on an empty stomach slows you down. Professional athletes don't skip breakfast.
              <!--2;00-->Fastened cardio does not burn more fat in the long run, which is what really matters.
              For example, <abbr>HIIT</abbr> burns more carbs than fat due to its high intensity. That does not imply that it is not good for burning fat:
              when the <abbr>HIIT</abbr> cardio session is over, the body burns more fat than carbs.
              <br /><!--2:53-->If you do slow, steady-state cardio on an empty stomach, <!--3:34-->the body may burn some of your muscle for energy.
              <!--4:15-->In order to burn fat instead of muscle, you need a calorie deficit in the long run. It does not matter when you burn the fat,
              <abbr>i.e.</abbr> during the cardio or after it. The longer the cardio session goes, the more fat will be burnt.
              <!--5:00-->For example, if you are on a 1200 calorie diet, you need to burn more than 1200 calories to lose fat.
              A 500 calorie deficit per day should result in one pound of fat loss per week.
              <br /><!--5:40-->If fasted cardio makes you feel good, you can keep doing it, but you shouldn't think it is better than normal cardio.

              (17 minutes, 06.03.2019).
              <br />Greg Doucette provides tips for maintaining a calorie deficit. The tips are not in any specific order.
              (1) Avoid crackers, doritos, chips, trail mix and similar calorie-rich snacks. You can replace them with &ldquo;smart pop pop-corn&rdquo;.
              <!--3:24-->(2) Avoid milk and cream; replace with Natrel lactose-free skimmed milk (it has 80 calories and 13 grams of protein per cup).
              (Natrel is a Canadian brand.)
              <!--4:55-->Dairy fat is not good for the human body.
              <!--5:05-->(3) Avoid ice cream; you can replace it with Greek ice cream yogurt bars. The contain around 90 to 100 calories.
              <!--6:36-->(4) Avoid candy (jelly beans etcetera); you can replace them with hard candy, which you cannto simply chew and swallow.
              <!--8:15-->(5) Avoid soft drinks or soda pop; replace them with diet versions. They don't cause cancer or make you eat more in the long run.
              <!--9:30-->(6) Avoid fruit juice; it contains too much sugar. It is better to eat the fruit it comes from instead of a less nutritious derivative that contains many empty calories.
              <!--11:34-->(7) Avoid cereals; <q cite="https://youtu.be/Yl7k42xqVvU?t=698">all cereals are bad</q>, even if the packaging claims the cereals are full of fiber or protein or both.
              They all make you eat more than you need.
              <!--12:59-->(8) Avoid nuts. A handful of nuts can contain 300 calories. For the healthy fats in nuts, you can drink almond milk instead.
              Nuts are for people who want to bulk up or who do a lot of cardio.
              <!--14:13-->(9) Replace condiments with light condiments. For example, replace ordinary ketchup with a sugar-free version.
              <!--15:20-->(10) Avoid muffins; you can replace them with cake. Even donuts contain fewer calories than muffins.

              (17 minutes, 11.05.2019).
              <ol>
                <li>Always warm up with light to moderate cardio. You should be slightly sweating at the start of the training session.</li>
                <li><!--1:04-->Train the hardest exercises first, instead of pre-fatiguing muscles. For example, if squats are the hardest exercise in the workout, do these first.</li>
                <li><!--1:58-->Instead of counting reps, time your sets, since &ldquo;time under tension&rdquo; is what counts.
                  For muscle hypertrophy, the time under tension should be around 40 seconds; a shorter time under tension benefits strength rather than hypertrophy.
                  But sets should not be shorter than 20 seconds.
                </li>
                <li><!--3:50-->The work-to-rest ratio should be between three-to-one and five-to-one.
                  For example, if a set takes one minute (which is long), the rest period should be between three and five minutes.
                  Shorter periods turn the workout into toning or cardio training and force you to use lower weights.
                </li>
                <li><!--7:13-->Make the eccentric phase longer than the concentric phase; ideally twice as long.
                  If you do 12 reps that last three seconds each, you get close to 40 seconds of time under tension.
                </li>
                <li><!--8:58-->Train hard sets close to failure. (If you can do five sets of 10 reps, the first four sets were too light.)</li>
                <li><!--10:06-->Use proper form. Otherwise you either don't hit the right muscles, or you get injured.</li>
                <li><!--11:22-->Active rest helps clearing lactic acid from the muscles.</li>
                <li><!--12:44-->Train each body part twice a week, especially weak body parts.
                  A small muscle such as the biceps can handle between 15 and 20 sets per week, which means 7 to 10 sets per session.
                  Bigger muscles such as the back and the legs can handle 20 to 30 sets per week.
                  The exact number depends on the person, training experiecen and other factors.
                </li>
                <li><!--14:25-->Always stretch after a workout in order to prevent tightness and injuries.
                  (Stretching before a workout makes you weaker.)

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_73Sg6Xu8Tk">How To Properly Warm-Up For Your Hard Training Sessions - Weight - Sets - Reps</a>
              (17 minutes, 05.02.2020).
              <br />This is not about the cardio warmup, which is easy, but about warmups with weights.
              Warmup sets are meant to prepare you for the actual sets that count towards the workout.
              Most people need two or three warmup sets before the actual hard sets.
              In the first warmup should uses roughly half the weight of a hard sets and run to double the number of reps of a hard set.
              After the warmup set, you should rest until the muscle no longer feels fatigued.
              The second warmup set should use around 70 percent of the weight of a hard set and consist of fewer reps than the first warmup set.
              This set should still be easy; you should be able to do ten more reps if you wanted to.
              After the second warmup set, you will need to rest a bit longer, possibly a minute to a minute and a half.
              The last warmup set should have a rep range of 10 to 12.
              If you plan to train to failure with heavey weights and a low rep range, you will need more warmup sets.
              <br />If after the hard sets for the first exercise, you plan to do another exercise for the same muscle,
              you need only one or two warmup sets because the muscle is already warmed up.

              There is a place for CrossFit but it is a horrific fitness model. It inspires many people to start exercising, but they are often taught bad form and shortcuts (such poor squatting and deadlifts, kipping pullups and kipping dips).
              Personal trainers would teach proper form and help you reach a fitness-related goal instead of helping you to get good at working out.
              Instead of doing CrossFit, Alan Robets advises,

              1:59: Alan Roberts says he takes in one gram per pound of lean body mass per day, which at the time of the creation of the video amounted to 175-180 grams per day.
              Above that amount of protein, it is more useful to add carbs instead of protein as a source of energy for your workouts.

              According to Alan Roberts, [0:26] 99% of people who call themselves hardgainers are simply very lazy.
              However, there is a small percentage of people who try to do everything the right way - eat as well as they can, get the right amount of sleep, work out with intensity and a good program -
              and who still have problems putting on muscle mass. Usually, this is because their metabolic level is so high that they burn through the calories they take in before they can start building muscle.
              They cannot ingest enough food to reach a caloric excess.
              Alan Roberts gvies the example of someone who thought he ate a lot and was at a level of 3000 calories per day.
              He had difficulty increasing this to 4300-4400 calories per day.
              However, morst "hardgainers" have deficiencies in food, sleep or training intensity (or a combination of these).

              In addition, if you are overweight, five-minute workouts won't be enough, and the proposed time for each round of the workout does not add up.
              The workout consists of four sets (with a 45-second rest period between them) of the following exercises: 12 plank hip dips, 12 prisoner squats and 12 plank walkouts.

              Alan Roberts is not a Mark Rippetoe fan, for example because of his negative opinions about yoga.
              Rippetoe's book Starting Strength is a book for beginners; for example, it teaches people how to squat.
              Alan Roberts changed his squats from low-bar squats to high-bar squats in order to protect his back and increase his strength,
              and suggest that you don't learn to squat from a book. Watching videos by Alan Thrall, for example, or getting a really good trainer, should be more helpful.
              The Rippetoe-style squat does not seem to work for very heavy squats and it is difficult to reteach yourself the motor pathways required to squat in a different way.
              For this reason, it is important to learn to perform the squat the right way from the beginning, i.e. so you don't need to relearn the movement later on.

              This video is a response to a question sent to Alan Roberts through YouTube or Instagram about how to get back into lifting as middle-aged man.
              First, you shoud visit your doctor to make sure you are fit to get back into lifting.
              Second, you should set challenging but realistic goals (e.g. related to fat loss).
              Third, you should get some guidance on the basic movements, ideally from a personal trainer.
              Then you should find out how to fit the training and nutrition changes into your lifestyle.
              Last but not least, no need to be consistent with your training and your nutrition.
            * "For Skinny Guys That Want To Gain Mass Without Getting Fat", 4 minutes, 16.01.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPEZWD_aRVU
              Getting fat doesn't happen over night. It's much easier to lose fat than to become fat, because you only need to take in fewer calories than you burn.
              1:53: However, a lean bulk is hard because you need to stay at at around 200 calories above your caloric maintenance.
              You can add 200 calories to your nutritional program by adding, for example, another cup of rice every single day.
              2:16: As long as you are getting the right amount of protein, you should add carbohydrates, since these also help build muscle, and then evaluate your progress at the end of every week.
              You can take a picture of yourself in the mirror and compare it with the picture from the week before. You may find yourself losing some vascularity.
              However, if you notice yourself gaining fat, e.g. love handles, you will need to cut back a bit.
              2:41: You need to find your caloric maintenance level and just go 200 calories above it. You need to be consistent with this.
              2:47: If you try a so-called dirty bulk, you will gain body fat, because those excess calories will not all be turned into muscle.

              Alan Roberts criticizes an Instagram video in which V Shred explains how to perform the deadlift. Unfortuntely, Vince from V Shred's instructions are both incomplete and inaccurate.
              [3:40] He does not explain how wide apart the feet should be (the puts them too far apart for a conventional deadlift but too close together for a sumo deadlift),
              [3:55] which part of the feet should be under the bar (just the toes, the midfoot or the entire foot)
              [4:14] and his arms are farther apart than they should be (they should be shoulder-width apart for a conventional deadlift).
              [4:50] The deadlift is one of the more complicated exercises in fitness and that can easily lead to injuries, even with a relatively light weight.
              [5:35] Other issues with V Shred's video are that his arms aren't straight enough and his upper back is rounded.
              [6:15] Moreover, he does not explain how to stabilise your core.
              [9:55] Vince does not mention the importance of engaging the lats, keeping a neutral spine, bracing your core.

              The actor was apparently unaware that these terms were coined in the context of psychology, not fitness.

              When you have lot of muscle mass, your heart needs to pump harder.

              If you just want to remaint fit for a long time, your priority is not to optimise your workouts, your nutrition etcetera;

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAf5vjtHpAw">Suggestions For Lifting Beginners</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 09.05.2018).
          <br />Alan Roberts sells several training programmes on his site, for example
          <a href="https://everydamndayfitness.net/collections/e-d-d-f-signature-series-programs/products/e-d-d-f-lean-mass-hypertrophy-program"><abbr>E.D.D.F.</abbr> LEAN MASS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM</a>

          In this no-nonsense video, he explains that he once considered creating a programme for beginners and why he decided not to do that after all.
          Beginners should learn the four basic lifts (the bench press, the squat, the deadlift and the overhead press), but these exercises shouldn't be taught using distance learning.
          The reason is that there are both mental and physical variables that need to be taken into account by a coach who is physically present can correct (and a video can't).
          Physiological variablese that need to be taken into account include height, weight, age, body fat percentage, the length of the femur, even the length of the femur's neck.
          <br />For this reason, Alan Roberts recommends that beginners should find a strength coach who can teach the four basic lifts in person.
          After about six months of getting proficient at these exercises, beginners can start worrying about curls or a novice programme,
          <abbr>i.e.</abbr> a three-times-per-week full-body programme that builds on the four basic lifts.
          Males who have between 12 and 20% body fat shouldn't worry too much about nutrition as long as they stay withing that range.
          If beginners start aiming for caloric deficits in order to make their abs visible, they will rob themselves of what Alan Roberts calls "noob gains" or lean mass gains.
          As long as you eat healthy (with sufficient protein, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass) and work out hard using the four basic lifts,
          you will develop a good-looking physique.
          Alan Robets doesn't believe in supplemenation for beginners; they should be getting enough protein through regular food.
          He stresses the fact that training needs to be consistent: <q>fitness is a lifestyle</q>.

          First, younger people at the gym don't care about what you used to do or be able to do.
          Second, use a towel in the locker room and in the sauna.
          Third, stop staring at girls who are half your age and who are working out in tight clothes.
          Fourth, ask a trainer or research what to do instead of making up your own exercises. If the gym offers a free walkthrough, use that walkthrough.
          Fifth, seek advice, not friendship.
          Finally, follow the rest of the gym etiquette rules, such as putting the weights back and moving away from a machine once you're done with an exercise.

           13:50: Muscles are basically speaking the language of tension, they can't read the number on the side of the plate.
           14:43: You need to get over the human desire to speak the language of numbers because the body doesn't speak that way.
           When you go into the gym on a day when you aren't feeling your best, you can downshift the weights and make sure you work the muscles until you feel the tension. This can make workouts very productive.
           18:00: In athletics, there are times you want to the muscles to work together, and you need to train that to, but in a controlled way. You need to train muscles both together and separately.
           18:29: There is currently an obsession with total body training, discrediting years of experience with splitting up training.
           20:55: Q: Is doing exercises standing up about involving the whole body chain? JC: If I have a choice between a seated option and a standing option, I prefer the standing option. [ground force -> carry-over effects]
           22:25: Jeff infrequently trains body builders. "That doesn't have as much purpose for me or value."
           22:37: Q: What do clients or YouTube viewers want more than anything?
           22:48: The immediate thing is looking better. Even for athletes outside of the game. People also want to feel better, have no aches or injuries. Many injuries come to JC because they want to get of certain problems.
           24:45: [Consitency] Even if you manage to go to the gym and train for one hour, there are still 23 other hours in the day in which you can ruin what you achieved in the gym by improper nutrition.
           26:00: Training consistently three times per week already requires a high level of commitment, and being consistent with nutrition demands even more commitment.
           26:50: This is why it is important to dumb it down instead of counting macros and calories. If it is too difficult to count macros and calories, you won't be able to be consistent.
           This is why he came up with the simple trick of dividing the plate up: protein in one third, fibers and carbohydrates in the other space.
           28:10: In the remaining two thirds of the plate, put twice as many fibrous carbohydrates than starchy carbohydrates.
           28:25: Examples of good fibrous carbohydrates include broccoli, asparaghus (not necessarily boiled), etc. Make it taste good.
           29:15: Just eating oatmeal with water would be impossible to keep up for 15 years, so he puts other things on top of it.
           30:00: We don't spend enough time finding food we like. For example, whipped cream contains almost no calories.
           30:30: For starchy carbs, sweet potatoes are great; pasta is also great.
           31:00: Jeff is not against carbohydrates, but it is easy to overindulge in them, unlike steaks or fat.
           31:45: Q: We do we overindulge in carbs? Possibly, our bodies naturally crave them. 
           32:12: Carb-exclusive diets cannot last in the long term, and it is not worth investing time in a type of nutrition that you will need to give up eventually.
           33:20: The value of the clock: there are times of the day when I prefer to eat. If you don't plan you meals, you may end up eating sporadically.
           33:55: This is probably why intermittent fasting is successful: it applies rules around timing.
           34:40: If you get hungry around an hour before the next meal and you have fixed meal times, you know when the next meal is coming. Without a set time, it becomes more tempting to just grab food.
           35:05: Jeff does not do intermittent fasting. He does not experiment with his nutrion because he likes where he's at.
           35:30 / 36:00: When trying to get lean, men typically lose fat from their face some time before they lose the fat in the lower belly, especially when they get older.
           36:14: Q: You've said that being lean over time is one of the best things you can do for your later years.
           36:21: After the age of forty it becomes much harder to lose fat and create a certain look.
           37:35: So it's important to start early and turn it into a lifestyle.
           39:00: Q Should everybody be training daily, regardless of age? Not necessarily daily; recovery and having an off-day is important. Recovery can also come in the form of active recovery.
           39:37: However, the commitment to nutrition should be kept up 7 days a week.
           41:49: Cheatmeals can help people maintain their sanity. If your goal is 11-12% bodyfat, then cheatmeals can be worked in strategically a few times per week.
           The problem is that people tend to work in more cheat meals.

          <br />In the traditional upright row, the elbows end up above the shoulders and the wrists, which requires internal rotation in the shoulders.
          The authors propose modifications to the technique to make it safe and effective.
          The bar should be raised through the elbows, not the wrists, and should move as close to the body as possible.
          In addition, the arms should be raised so they make an angle of at most 90° with the upper body.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Men's Health</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 27.11.2018).
          <br />Luke Zocchi, Chris Hemsworth's personal trainer, explains the workout he designed for Hemsworth for the film <i>Men in Black: Internationalk</i> (2019).
          The workout was designed to achieve a less bulky look than Thor and to be doable while travelling, so it involves only bodyweight and a pair of dumbbells.
          <!--1:30-->It starts with a warm-up that involves bear crawls (10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds) and
          bodyweight squats (also 10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds).
          <!--2:32-->The other exercises are weighted burpee (8 reps), curl to press (8 reps), goblet squats (8 reps), standing triceps extensions (8 reps), reverse lunge curls (8 reps),
          a shoulder excercise that cycles through a lateral raise, a front raise and an upright row (8 reps), and three plank variations:
          plank punches (8 reps), plank pulses (8 reps) and plank pikes (8 reps).
          This set of exercises are done in a cycle for thirty minutes.
          <br /><strong>Warning</strong>: Skip or replace the upright rows in the shoulder exercise;
          the upright row demonstrated in this video raises the elbows above shoulder level, which brings your shoulders into internal rotation,
          and this can be harmful to the shoulder joints.

    If you want to change what your body looks like, setting a specific goal (e.g. "I need to lose x kilos", "I want to get x% body fat") is better than setting a vague goal (e.g. "I want to look good").
    Specific goals increase your chances of reaching those goals. The video shows the vlogger's body at varying levels of body fat and when the sixpack becomes visible (i.e. at less than 15% body fat).
    For deep cuts in the abs, you should have at most 10% body fat, which is very hard to achieve for longer periods of time for most people.
    5:35: The video than shows how you can calculate your target weight.
    First calculate your "current lean body mass" (CLBM), i.e. your theoretical weight without fat. This can be calculated as follows: CLBM = current weight x (100 - body fat percentage).
    6:18: Then you need to establish your "goal lean body mass" (GLBM), i.e. the percentage of your current lean body mass that will remain. He uses a conservative estimate of 97%.
    7:20: E.g. GLBM = CLBM * 97%. (If you do a lot of cardio, you can lose more; not just fat but also muscle.)
    8:10: Then you calculate your goal weight W = GLBM / (100 - goal body fat %). The vlogger assumes a goal of around 13% body fat, hence W = GLBM / 0.87.
    [CLBM = 60 x (1 - 0.17) = 60 x 0.83 = 49.8; GLBM = 49.8 * 0.97 = 48.306; goal weight = 48.306 / 0.87 = 55.52]
    9:50: Finally, he calculate the "time to six-pack value" or TT6 = (current weight - goal weight) / (rate of weight loss per week).
    11:40: He recommends a rate of weight loss of 0.5 to 1% of your current weight.
    [TT6 = 4.5 k / (0.5 k/week) = 9 weeks.

    - 10 mg of boron per day (over at least a seven-day period); not more than 20mg per day. Boron lowers SHBG (sex hormone-binding globulin) and increases levels of free testosterone.
    - D-Aspartic Acid: 2.6 - 3 mg per day: elevates the production of LH (luteinizing hormone)
    - Vitamin D3: RDA is 15 mcg per day; 50 mcg will promote T-formation.
    - Ashwagandha aka Withania Somnifera or Indian ginseng. Consuming 300 mg of ashwagandha (over a six-week period) resulted in testosterone increasing by 96.2 ng/dl.
    - 10 mg per kilo of body weight daily (over four weeks, especially when combined with exercise. "most people agree that 200 mg is sufficient to stimulate testosterone production"
    - Fenugreek blocks testosterone from turning into estrogen. Take 300 mg of fenugreek per day.
    - Ginseng: Back in 1996, scientists discovered that this powerful root not only raised testosterone levels, but also heightened the production of LH. For serious T-boosting effects, consume between 100-200 mg of ginseng daily.
    - Zinc: supplementing with 40 mg of zinc per day elevates testosterone levels. [Overdose?]
    - "DHEA is a steroid hormone we naturally produce it can convert into testosterone and estrogen."

    The liver and the muscles store some glycogen, and the this reserve gets depleted within roughly 30 minutes of exercising. After that, you start burning fat.
    Taking in whey protein or anything sweet before, during or after a workout will cause a spike in insulin (and therefore interrupt the fat-burning process).
    The more concentrated the whey protein is, the bigger the spike in insulin will be. However, a normal egg, which contains fat, has a much smaller insulin response than concentrated protein.
    If the goal is to burn fat, eating before, during or after a workout is a bad idea.
    The protein you take in before or after a workout needs at least 24 hours to get digested, go through the liver and end up in the muscles.
    It is the meals you ate the day before that are building your muscles.
    In addition, if your liver is overloaded with too much protein, the protein won't end up in your muscles.
    It is important to know that insulin nullifies growth hormoone. If you eat during the recovery phase after a workout, you will slow down the benefits of weight loss and muscle building.
    The benefits of exercise occur 24 to 48 hours after the workout, during deep sleep phases.
    There are exceptions, however: if you are an athlete, if you work out twice a day, if you are a huge body builder or if you do long-distance running; but these are not what the video is about.
    Most people who exercise want to burn fat. Growth hormone is the main fat-burning hormone that is activated by exercise.
    Since insulin blocks growth hormone and therefore work against the effects of muscle building and lean body mass.
    Growth hormonone is triggered by exercise, sleep and hypoglycemia, so we want to exercise to lower our blood sugar level (i.e. moderate hypoglycemia).

    There is not such thing as a 30-minute anabolic window after a workout. According to science, the post-workout window 
    According to a study as McMaster University (Ontario), we have a 50% increase in protein synthesis four hours after a workout, but this rises to 109% 24 hours after the workout.
    The protein synthesis level only starts to decline after 24 hours and does not come back to baseline until 36 hours after the workout.
    Another study looked at 33 individuals. One third of them consumed protein immediately before and after a workout, a second group took in protein in the morning and in the evening,
    and the third group did not make any cognitive changes to their nutrition whatsoever.
    After a ten-week structure-resistance training program, there were no differences between the three groups regarding strength gains,
    cosmetic changns, fat loss or overall protein synthesis. So the moment of protein intake did not make a difference.
  * "Dr. Berg & Thomas DeLauer's Joint Video: The 3 Myths of Muscle Building", SixPackAbs.com, 12 minutes, 27.02.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYCevT0dBac
    Myth 1: We need carbo hydrates to build muscle. We do need insulin build muscle, but if you eat too many carbohydrates, you block insulin.
    High-carbohydrate diets block muscle growth. However, ketones, which increase in low-carb diet, preserve carbohydrates in our muscles.
    4:28: Myth 2: We needs lots of protein to build muscle because are muscles are made of protein. Actually, the body recycles protein and does not lose a lot of it. (+ keto and growth hormone)
    On average, a person needs between three and six ounces of high-quality protein per meal.
    5:52: Studies found that you need only 0.5 - 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight if you want to build up muscle.
    If you eat too much protein, you can trigger gluconeogenesis, the conversion of excess protein into sugar, which ultimately gets stored as fat.
    Too much protein can also have a negative effect on your kidneys. It is better to get good quality organic meat. Thomas DeLauer consumes only 90-100 grams of protein per day.
    8:20: Myth 3: Building more muscle will burn more fat. In fact, building more muscle will help you burn more calories.
    So how do we burn more fat calories as opposed to sugar calories. The body needs to learn to burn fat.
    Ketosis means that you are nutritionally priming the body to use fats for fuel during that period of time.
    Fat adaptation goes a step further: your body is so accustomed to using ketones for fuel that it changes its chemistry (the mitochondria) to become more receptive to fat.
    You need to exercise using some intermittent fasting techniques. (See other videos by Thomes DeLauer.)

    Two of the videos conclusions:
    4:15: (1) Current research shows that taking low amounts of creatine daily (5 grams) is effective in improving muscular strength and improving recovery.
    (2) Creatine absorption is improved with carbohydrate intake and possibly with sodium intake, so it should be taken with a small amount of food to maximize effects.
    Note that Dr. Albertson sells a calcium citrate and creatine powder on her website (https://www.boneandmuscle.com/).

    Fasting -> growth hormone.

    See also https://www.biolayne.com/articles/supplementation/growth-hormone-great-expectations/
    xx points out that fasting is not anabolic but protein synthesis is.
    Training fasted or not is a matter of preference.
    Building up muscle consumes energy, but in a fasted state, the body wants to preserve energy, so there is a conflict.
    Giving someone growth hormone leads to an increase in lean body mass, which here means connective tissue and body water, not muscle mass.
    So stop doing things to increase growth hormones.
    Question in the comments: "When Insulin levels are low growth hormone levels are high? meaning low carb diets equal higher growth hormone levels?"
    Biolayne's answer: "only due to substrate mobilization.  Growth hormone is released to mobilize fuel.  Insulin is released to store."
    Question in the comments: "GH doesn't build muscle, but IGF-1 is, right? Because I know GH is converted in the liver to IGF-1. So you can say GH is INDIRECTLY does build muscle?"
    Biolayne's answer: "no.  systemic igf-1 is not anabolic.  only the autocrine IGF-1 released by the muscle cells themselves (also called mechano growth factor or MGF) is anabolic"

    4:38 (https://youtu.be/vfFo5yX9OfA?t=278): "A prolonged fasted state by definition is a catabolic state", i.e. catabolic processes are greater than anabolic processes.
    Being fasted in isolation (!) is not anabolic and does not promote muscle growth.
