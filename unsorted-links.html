          - Obama Fails Again With Out-Of-Touch Speech That Proves How Bad He Is, 16 minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrqAUebq6Ic
            Barack Obama says that young people should not take "our sytems of government and our way of life" for granted.
            Jimmy Dore that Obama gutted the Consitution by taking away "habeas corpus"; now Donald Trump does not worry about it.
            Obama signed Section 1021 of the NDAA because he wanted to use it or was already using it.
            2:35: Obama says, "We have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries".
            Jimmy Dore points out that the USA were bombing seven different countries at the time. Jimmy Dore: (3:07): "They ran out of bombs to drop on Syria this year."
            He also bombed Yemen at the Behest of Saudi Arabia. And all of it for fossil fuels.
            4:35: "Barack Obama is a great politician because he can say nothing and really mean it."
            5:18: Obama's version of democracy "is to ask Wall Street, Big Pharma and the fossil fuels what they want and then go out in a real pretty way, with his pretty face, and screw over the people, and convince them that's what they need".

        (<i class="ytchannel">The Humanist Report</i> on YouTube, 13 minutes, 20.09.2018).
        <br />In an interview on <abbr>CNN</abbr>, Jake Tapper asks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez what corporate media always ask politicians promoting Medicare for All: <q>How do you pay for it?</q>
        They never ask this question to politicians promoting war; they only ask this about policies that specifically benefit the American people.
        1:04: Jake Tapper begins by presenting the "Dem socialist price tag": $32 trillion for Medicare for All, $5.4 on jobs guarantee, $1.4 on student loans and $1.3 on free college, paid family leave and Social Security expansion,
        totalling over $40 trillion over the next decade. Raising taxes on the very wealthy and increasing corporate tax rates would raise $2 trillion over the next decade,
        so Tapper asks where the other $38 trillion will come from.
        1:20: AOC points out that Medicare for All would save the American people a very large amount of money and that many of the suggested policies have been "accomplished by every modern civilised democracy in the western world".

        <q>A former staffer from The Apprentice named Noel Casler unleashed a bombshell about the President’s personal life this past weekend during a show he was performing. Casler claims that Trump is a “speed freak” who likes to crush up Adderall and snort it, which helps explain his erratic and manic behavior. The evidence certainly suggests that something is up with the President, and Ring of Fire’s Farron Cousins examines these new allegations.</q>

        <br />For the 2016 presidential election campaign, mainstream media gave Donald Trump two billion dollars' worth of media coverage.
        Now they are covering Donald Trump's soft coup because that attracts lots of viewers and thereby a lot of advertising revenue.
        In the mean time, other important themes, such as climate change, are ignored.
        After Biden's inauguration, they will probably let Donald Trump and his supporters in the Republican party phone in or give them screentime without factchecking what they say.

          The Supreme Court should not have decided that the counting of ballots can continue after 3 November becuase, according to Trump, this increases the risk of fraud.
          As soon as the election is over, Trump's lawyers will check (what exactly?). He especially wants to prevent a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania.
          He claims, 2:39, "everyone knows what happens in Philadelphia, you don't have to say it, but I've read about it for years. And I don't think it's fair that we have to wait a long period of time after the election.
          If people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before that, [a] long time."
          However, Trump had made sure that the ballots would show up late.

      The big networks are waiting to declare Biden's victory in the presidential election. Fox News called Arizona for Biden before any other network did.
      The Associated Press then followed Fox. The New York Times has still not declared Arizona as won for Biden.

      There are also news reports about Rupert Murdoch calling Mitch McConnell and telling not to feed Trump's conspiracy theories.
      2:00: Hartmann's theory is that all the networks are waiting for Fox to declare Biden as the winner,
      "because Fox has the greatest credibility to call the election for Biden right now, given that Fox has been the cheerleader for Trump for five years."
      If Fox calls the election first, Trump can't call the other networks "fake news".

      The election is over, even if Trump should win the recount in Georgia, which is unlikely. Biden will probably win the popular vote by 5%.
      The Democrats were projected to win back the Senate, but it does not look like this will happen.
      They also lost four seats in the House of Representatives.
      Each Democrat who supported Medicare for All was re-elected, including Democrats in swing districts.
      By contrast, several right-wing Democrats lost their seats. Katie Porter, a left-wing Democrat in a swing district, cruised the re-election.
      However, the Democratic establishment try to push the opposite idea: namely that left-wing ideas cause the party to underperform.
      Ilhan Omar, another left-wing Democrat, Ilhan Omar and Rashid Tlaib increased turnout, which in turn helped win Biden Minnesota and Michican, respectively.
      John Kasich in Ohio endorsed Biden, who got obliterated by Trump in Ohio.
      AOC should not call for unifying with the Democratic establishment but attack them for their corruption.
      If the polls had been correct, Joe Biden would have won 351 electoral votes, but he lost North Carolina and Florida.
      Biden underperformed in several states he was supposed to win.
      Kyle Kulinski's worst-case was that Biden would win 321 electoral votes, but Biden did still worse than that.
      The Democrats can't do any better because they don't stand for anything.
      For example, in Florida, there was a direct-ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage, which got 60% of the votes.
      In spite of this, Donald Trump still beat Joe Biden by at least three points in Florida, because Joe Biden had neglected to talk about minimum wage in his speeches and interviews.
      The Democrats did not even manage to win against Mitch McConnell, who blocked a huge stimulus package.
      Stating that they are "not Donald Trump" is not enough for Democrats to decisively win election.
      11:18: Bernie Sanders would have won much more comfortably, winning Ohio and Iowa against Trump.
      However, the Democrats refuse to learn from this, since they are already blaming the left for their poor performance.

      Attorney Sidney Powell claims that the Republican governor of Georgia is involved in a scheme with the CIA to make Trump lose in Georgia so he can benefit from election insurance set up by Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013.
      Whereas Republicans publicly claim that the presidential election was stolen by means of voter fraud, Trump's legal team makes no claims of voter fraud in court.
      In court, Trump's legal team makes it clear that what they are alleging has nothing to do with fraud.
      For example, in a Pennsylvania federal case, Giuliani that "this is not a fraud case". In a state case in Pennsylvania, Trump lawyer Jonathan S. Goldstein
      denied that he was accusing anybody of fraud. In Maricopa Count, Arizona, Trump attorney Kory Langhofer said he was not alleging fraud or even that there were glitches in the voting machines.
      In a court in Nevada, Trump lawyers did not allege fraud eiter; instead, they focus on much smaller claims.
      Even Trump supporters such as Tucker Carlson are now calling Sidney Powell's conspiraty theory into doubt.

      Philip Rucker of The Washington Post reports that Trump has been very reluctant to agree to the General Services Administration (GSA) allowing the Biden transition to take place, since that implies a concession on the part of the president.
      There have been calls from Republican senators, and an open letter from national security veterans calling on the Trump administration to let the Biden transition begin.
      Stephen A. Schwarzman, the CEO of The Blackstone Group, "who is perhaps president Trump's closest ally in the business community", publicly said that Biden had won the election and that the country needed to move on.
      This allowed Trump's advisers to convince the president to allow the transition to begin.

      The origin of the wide-spread idea that vitamin C can cure your cold was a book by Linus Pauling ("Vitamin C and the Common Cold").
      Adults need between 75 and 90 mg of vitamin C per day, and the vitamin can be found in many foods.
      Pauling recommended taking 2000 mg per day, but studies did not find that vitamin C does not shorten a cold significantly.
      2000 mg vitamin C per day increases the risk of diarrhoea and kidney stones.
      Vitamin C is most helpful for people engaged in intense physical exercise, for example marathon runners.
      The best cure for the common cold is rest and hydration.

      Calcium supplements are potentially dangerous because the cause a spike of calcium in the blood that lasts up to eight hours. This increases the risk of blood cots and cardiovascular problems.
      Adults need 500-700 mg of calcium daily. There are a number of vegan sources of calcium, for example: 
      100g of kale contains 139 mg of calcium, 1 cup of collard greens contains 357 grams of calcium, 100g of calcium set tofu contains 350 mg of calcium,
      30 g of almonds contain 75 mg of calcium, 100g of chia seeds contains 631 g of calcium and 1 cup of steamed bok choy contains 158 mg of calcium.
      Calcium-fortified plant milks can also be helpful, e.g. soy, oat and almond milk. The human body absorbs the calcium from soy milk just as well as from cow's milk.
      (See the study "Calcium absorption in Australian osteopenic post-menopausal women: (...)" by Tang, Walter et al, 2010: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20460239 .)
      The ideal sources of calcium are low-oxalate dark green vegetables (except spinach, Swiss chards and beet greens, which contain few calcium that we can absorb).
      These are better sources than fortified milks because they are not processed foods without added sodium salt; they also provide fiber, folate and potassium.
      Drinking fortified milks is still better than talking calcium supplements, because they don't cause huge spikes in calcium levels in the blood.

    * "Do Not Eat Peanut Butter Again, Until You Watch This...",  Dr. Eric Berg DC
      First, the peanut's shell can easily absorb what's in the soil, and since peanuts are heavily sprayed, they absorb a lot of the pesticides, herbicides, fungicides etcetera that are sprayed on them.
      Second, in the USA, peanuts are not GMO but they are crop-rotated with cotton, which has been genetically modified to resist glyphosate (in Roundup). So glyphosate ends up in peanuts.
      When glyphosate started to be used, there was also a spike in peanut allergies, which may not be a coincidental.
      Third, aflatoxin is a poisonous carcinogen produced by certain molds that grow on peanuts (and some other plants); this toxin causes liver cancer.
      Fourth, peanut butter often contains a lot of sugar.
      However, Dr. Berg also mentions positive things about peanut butter.
      First, there is a type of peanut batter called "valencia", which has the lowest amount of aflotoxins.
      Second, when you buy organic peanut butter, you get fewer chemicals such as pesticides and fungicides.
      Third, when peanuts are roasted or germinated, you increase the availability of the nutrients.
      Fourth, chlorophyl can reduce the aflotoxin, so if you consume some salad or other plant containing chlorophyl, you reduce the aflotoxin.
      Fifth, peanuts are comparable in nutritional value to other nuts; they also contain protein.

      It is because must bodies the doctor examines are much too alkaline. Check the symptoms for acidosis versus alkalosis.
      High stress (cortisol) makes your body more alkaline, which then blocks the absorption of calcium (symptoms: twitching in the eye, cramping in the calf, neuritis).
      You also lose potassium, which makes the body even more alkaline.
      People who consume a lot of protein (e.g. protein shakes) also have guanidine (a waste product), which can cause twitching, nerve pain and arthritis. Apple cider vinegar flushes out the guanidine.

      Looks at the study "Vinegar Intake Reduces Body Weight, Body Fat Mass, and Serum Triglyceride Levels in Obese Japanese Subjects" by Tomoo Kondo, Mikiya Kishi, et al (Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 73.8 (2009).
      The study involved only obese subjects, so the results may not extrapolate to lean healthy subjects.
      He also mentions "Influence of tolerability of vinegar as a oral source of short-chain fatty acids on appetite control and food intake" by J. Darzi et al (Internationnal Journal of Obesity, 2013).
      The most important effect of vinegar is that it can lower blood sugar. See the study "Vinegar consumption can attenuate postprandial glucose and insulin responses; a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials" by Farideh Shishebor et al (Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 2017).
      Nippard points out that the beneficial effects are generally larger in subjects with diabetese or insulin resistance.
      He adds that "apple cider vinegar's antiglycemic effect is dependent on the type of carbohydrate you're consuming":
      "It is more effective when taken with complex carbohydrates, and it does not seem to work at all in response to simple sugar consumption" [sugar should be avoid anyhow].
      He says that this is due to the fact that "apple cider vinegar seems to work by inhibiting starch digestion, so it will be most effective when you're eating starchy, complex carbohydrates".

      (1) It's all about the other person. You need to see things from other people's perspective. "In order to become a good conversationalist, you have to become an investigator in people."
      (2) Make other people feel valued. Remember and use people's names.
      (3) Give genuine complements. Complementing somebody on their personality (e.g. "You're a very good listener") is very powerful.
