      - "TOP 5 WORST EXERCISES (Stop Doing These!!)", 11 minutes, 17.04.2014: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6Y3WDY1tUo
        Jeff Cavaliere judges exercises based on their risks-to-benefits ratio.
        - 1:22: chest flys: at the bottom of the movement, the exercise no longer stretches the chest but the coracobrachialis; going too far down can cause a torn pec.
          2:41: alterative: cable cross over (standing)
        - 2:51: behind-the-neck should press involves pushing in an abnormal plane of motion, which increases the risk of impingement. Alternative exercises have the elbows in front of your body.
        - 5:08: upright rows pushes the shoulders into an impingement position.
        - 6:36: good mornings
        - 7:58: leg extensions (shearing force on the knees etc.) can lead to patellar tendon issues.

      - "Calisthenics Workouts: Pros and Cons (TOP 4!)", 9 minutes, 11.03.2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAJXkAOlnqM
        Pros: (1) It is inexpensive, since you don't need to pay for equipment or a gym membership.
        (2) You can do bodyweight exercises anywhere; (3) bodyweight exercises are typically more athletic because they are compound movements (whereas exercises involving weights tend to isolate muscles).
        (4) Bodyweight exercises are good for conditioning and fat loss (compound movement allow you to burn more body fat).
        4:29: Cons: (1) Bodyweight exercises are not necessarily the best fit if you are trying to train around in injury, since it is harder to isolate specific joints etc.
        (2) Bodyweight exercises require more co-ordination (however, this can be trained also).
        (3) It is harder to progress, unless you understand very well how your body is moving, while you can easily add weight to a bar to make progress. this can cause you to plateau.
        (4) It is a myth that you can't use bodyweight exercises to build muscle or to get strong, but you need to know how to do it.

        Jeff talks about the "PUBMED posse" who grab PUBMED articles to claim your way of training is wrong and they are right. [Wearing a t-shirt.]
      - "Do This BEFORE Every Workout! (Guaranteed Gains)", 7 minutes, 16.05.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veXVvjc9_EA
        This video is not about a secret exercise but about being aware of your own efforts and not taking sets or reps off.
        "I think that many of us simply get comfortable in our workouts.  We start to call them workout routines.
        Nothing should be routine about your training other than the fact that you routinely show up to perform them.
        When it comes to your intensity levels however when doing your workouts I would bet that you are likely falling a little short in that department."
        "Regardless, the key is that you become self aware of your own efforts before every workout that you do.
        Once you know that you can likely fall into the trap of taking sets and reps off then you will be more likely to intervene and not do this."

      - "Body Fat for Abs to Show - The Truth! (MEN AND WOMEN)", 8 minutes, 09.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wqXNZbnZEs
        There is a range of body fat percentages at which your abs can become visible, even up to 19% body fat for men and 23% for women.
        You need to determine the body fat percentage that you are starting from and what level if visibility (or body fat) you want to achieve.
        You can then calculate approximately how long it should take to achieve your goal.
        If you choose to achieve your goal through a combination of nutrition and training, Jeff recommends a method that involves
        a caloric deficit of 500 calories per day through nutrition cuts and an additional 250 calorie deficit through training.
        This should result in a weight loss of 1.5 lbs (or 0.68 kilo) per week.
        (Jeff uses the example of a person weighing 200 lbs or 91 kilogram and 30% body fat at the start who needs to lose 40 lbs to reach 10% body fat.) 
      - "How to Get Bigger Legs Fast (QUARTER SQUATS!)", 7 minutes, 13.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cczwdE88FyY
        There is value to quarter squats. It is an exercise that focuses on the top range of motion, where you are strongest, just like the pin press or a mat-elevanted deadlift.
        The quarter squat can be beneficial for vertical jump height compared to the half squat and the full squat, according to a study published on PubMed.
        The downside was a loss in 40-yard sprint times.
        When doing quarter squats, you need to follow three rules: (1) you need to hinge from the hips and bend the knees,
        (2) quarter squats don't count towards personal records, and (3) you need to be willing to load the barbell more heavily then for a regular squat.
        In addition, the quarter squat should be used as a complement to the full squat, not as a replacement.
        There is also a variation of the quarter squat that is not performed at the top of the range of motion but at the bottom.
        This exercises trains the legs in their weaker range.

  * "I HATE PLANKS (and why you should too!)", ATHLEAN-X, 5 minutes, 15.12.2016: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDaXSXjuGc
    Planks is a good exercise but only for those who find it challenging, i.e. those who can't hold it more than a minute.
    He proposes alternatives that involve rotation and rely solely on body weight.
  * "Stop Doing Planks! (DO THIS INSTEAD)", ATHLEAN-X, 8 minutes, 17.01.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYX5FpYZA7c
    This video shows more advanced alternatives planks than the video from December 2016. Most of these involve bands or weights.
  * "Plank Progression - From Rookie to RIPPED ABS in 7 Minutes with Planks!", ATHLEAN-X, 7 minutes, 07.04.2012: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVrALzPc7dM
    This video presents a few variations to make the plank exercise more challenging.
    In the first variation, he recommends supporting yourself on your hands instead of on your elbows.
    In the second variation, he puts his feet on a bench.
    In the third variation, he recommends narrowing the base of support, both for the hands and the feet.
    In the final variation, he combines some of the previous principles.
  * "The TRUTH About Planks (IT’S UGLY!)", 9 minutes, 04.04.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWEXjdAGCQ
    This video explains a few weaknesses of the plank exercise and clears up a few mistunderstandings about it (e.g. benefits for the glutes and posture).
    Near the end of the video, he demonstrates a reverse plank that actually activates the glutes and the interscapular muscles.

  * "Bodybuilding Supplements Video - The SCARY TRUTH", 10 minutes, 10.02.2013: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqfM_QBYNFs
    - Some supplememnts contain magnesium stearate, which is just added to prevent ingredients from sticking to machinery and which your body does not need.
    - Not every gram of protein in a product will actually be absorbed by the body.
    - Stores that sell supplements are often incentivised by a manufacturer to recommend the manufacturer's products, not to tell you what is best for you.
    - Some pre-workout products contain 1,3-dimethylamylamine (dmaa), which should be banned because it is not healthy. (WebMD: https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1258/1-3-dmaa)
    - Nutrition comes first; supplementation makes no sense if your nutrition sucks.
  * Cavaliere, Jeff: "The Most DANGEROUS Diet in the World (STOP!)", ATHLEAN-X, 13 minutes, 29.08.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3bRVpy0VtE
    2:43: "The most dangerous diet in the world is the one you can't stick to." Also stay away from the diet cults, i.e. those who say that there is only one right way to feed yourself.
