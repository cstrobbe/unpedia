          Here is the first piece of public paper philosophy I ever published, in 2011. It’s on conspiracy theories and how they undermine democracy - focused on Trump’s then favored conspiracy theory, birtherism.

            Barack Obama says that young people should not take "our sytems of government and our way of life" for granted.
            Jimmy Dore that Obama gutted the Consitution by taking away "habeas corpus"; now Donald Trump does not worry about it.
            Obama signed Section 1021 of the NDAA because he wanted to use it or was already using it.
            2:35: Obama says, "We have lived in an era that has been largely stable and peaceful, at least in advanced countries".
            Jimmy Dore points out that the USA were bombing seven different countries at the time. Jimmy Dore: (3:07): "They ran out of bombs to drop on Syria this year."
            He also bombed Yemen at the Behest of Saudi Arabia. And all of it for fossil fuels.
            4:35: "Barack Obama is a great politician because he can say nothing and really mean it."
            5:18: Obama's version of democracy "is to ask Wall Street, Big Pharma and the fossil fuels what they want and then go out in a real pretty way, with his pretty face, and screw over the people, and convince them that's what they need".

        <br />Among other things, Chomsky says that Bernie Sanders's campaign was amazing, since few people knew him,
        he used the word &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; and did not rely on corporate money.
        Alan Greenspan, who has been hailed as one of the greatest economists in American history,
        has said that the economic growth he was praised for was based on growing worker insecurity.
        Many of Trump's voters could have voted for Sanders.

        <br />In an interview on <abbr>CNN</abbr>, Jake Tapper asks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez what corporate media always ask politicians promoting Medicare for All: <q>How do you pay for it?</q>
        They never ask this question to politicians promoting war; they only ask this about policies that specifically benefit the American people.
        1:04: Jake Tapper begins by presenting the "Dem socialist price tag": $32 trillion for Medicare for All, $5.4 on jobs guarantee, $1.4 on student loans and $1.3 on free college, paid family leave and Social Security expansion,
        totalling over $40 trillion over the next decade. Raising taxes on the very wealthy and increasing corporate tax rates would raise $2 trillion over the next decade,
        so Tapper asks where the other $38 trillion will come from.
        1:20: AOC points out that Medicare for All would save the American people a very large amount of money and that many of the suggested policies have been "accomplished by every modern civilised democracy in the western world".

        Four Republican senators have referred to Biden as the president elect: Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Ben Sasse.
        Other Republican senaors have admitted privately that Joe Biden won the election but refuse to do so publicly.
        When asked whether there was any fraud in their race, senators Joni Ernst and Steve Dains said she didn't believe so.
        Other senators said they didn't know and/or that the courts should decide about that: Mike Rounds (South Dakota) and

        <br />For the 2016 presidential election campaign, mainstream media gave Donald Trump two billion dollars' worth of media coverage.
        Now they are covering Donald Trump's soft coup because that attracts lots of viewers and thereby a lot of advertising revenue.
        In the mean time, other important themes, such as climate change, are ignored.
        After Biden's inauguration, they will probably let Donald Trump and his supporters in the Republican party phone in or give them screentime without factchecking what they say.
        Corporate networks serve corporate masters, not the American people, its viewers.

        (<i class="ytchannel">The Hill</i> on YouTube, 8 minutes, 11.12.2020).
        <br />According to Jimmy Dore, the (real) progressives should withhold their vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker until she puts Medicare for All to the vote.
        On a previous re-election of Nance Pelosi as speaker, other Democrats had forced her to move to the right.
        Jimmy Dore has also often explained to progressives that the Democratic establishment hates them more than the Republicans.
        (The Democratic establishment first eliminated Bernie Sanders from the presidential primaries before taking on Donald Trump.)
        On the other hand, Democrats who supported Medicare for All got re-elected to the House or the Senate.
        <br />Jimmy Dore's idea would later trend under the hashtag <code>#ForceTheVote</code>.

          The Supreme Court should not have decided that the counting of ballots can continue after 3 November becuase, according to Trump, this increases the risk of fraud.
          As soon as the election is over, Trump's lawyers will check (what exactly?). He especially wants to prevent a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania.
          He claims, 2:39, "everyone knows what happens in Philadelphia, you don't have to say it, but I've read about it for years. And I don't think it's fair that we have to wait a long period of time after the election.
          If people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before that, [a] long time."

      The big networks are waiting to declare Biden's victory in the presidential election. Fox News called Arizona for Biden before any other network did.
      The Associated Press then followed Fox. The New York Times has still not declared Arizona as won for Biden.
      Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch to complain about this. Rupert Murdoch informed Trump that he had lost.
      There are also news reports about Rupert Murdoch calling Mitch McConnell and telling not to feed Trump's conspiracy theories.
      2:00: Hartmann's theory is that all the networks are waiting for Fox to declare Biden as the winner,
      "because Fox has the greatest credibility to call the election for Biden right now, given that Fox has been the cheerleader for Trump for five years."
      If Fox calls the election first, Trump can't call the other networks "fake news".

      The election is over, even if Trump should win the recount in Georgia, which is unlikely. Biden will probably win the popular vote by 5%.
      The Democrats were projected to win back the Senate, but it does not look like this will happen.
      They also lost four seats in the House of Representatives.
      Each Democrat who supported Medicare for All was re-elected, including Democrats in swing districts.
      By contrast, several right-wing Democrats lost their seats. Katie Porter, a left-wing Democrat in a swing district, cruised the re-election.
      However, the Democratic establishment try to push the opposite idea: namely that left-wing ideas cause the party to underperform.
      Ilhan Omar, another left-wing Democrat, Ilhan Omar and Rashid Tlaib increased turnout, which in turn helped win Biden Minnesota and Michican, respectively.
      John Kasich in Ohio endorsed Biden, who got obliterated by Trump in Ohio.
      AOC should not call for unifying with the Democratic establishment but attack them for their corruption.
      If the polls had been correct, Joe Biden would have won 351 electoral votes, but he lost North Carolina and Florida.
      Biden underperformed in several states he was supposed to win.
      Kyle Kulinski's worst-case was that Biden would win 321 electoral votes, but Biden did still worse than that.
      The Democrats can't do any better because they don't stand for anything.
      For example, in Florida, there was a direct-ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage, which got 60% of the votes.
      In spite of this, Donald Trump still beat Joe Biden by at least three points in Florida, because Joe Biden had neglected to talk about minimum wage in his speeches and interviews.
      The Democrats did not even manage to win against Mitch McConnell, who blocked a huge stimulus package.
      Stating that they are "not Donald Trump" is not enough for Democrats to decisively win election.
      11:18: Bernie Sanders would have won much more comfortably, winning Ohio and Iowa against Trump.
      However, the Democrats refuse to learn from this, since they are already blaming the left for their poor performance.

      Chris Christie, Governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018, who voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, says that if Trump's legal team is unwilling to come forward with evidence for voter fraud,
      "that must the evidence doesn't exist". Trump's legal team has been a national embarassment.
      Larry Hogan, governor of Maryland, says the USA is beginning to look like a "banana republic" and says he is embarrassed that more people in the Republican Party aren't speaking up.
      On Twitter, Trump has urged state legislatures to flip the results of the election.

      Attorney Sidney Powell claims that the Republican governor of Georgia is involved in a scheme with the CIA to make Trump lose in Georgia so he can benefit from election insurance set up by Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013.
      Whereas Republicans publicly claim that the presidential election was stolen by means of voter fraud, Trump's legal team makes no claims of voter fraud in court.
      In court, Trump's legal team makes it clear that what they are alleging has nothing to do with fraud.
      For example, in a Pennsylvania federal case, Giuliani that "this is not a fraud case". In a state case in Pennsylvania, Trump lawyer Jonathan S. Goldstein
      denied that he was accusing anybody of fraud. In Maricopa Count, Arizona, Trump attorney Kory Langhofer said he was not alleging fraud or even that there were glitches in the voting machines.
      In a court in Nevada, Trump lawyers did not allege fraud eiter; instead, they focus on much smaller claims.
      Even Trump supporters such as Tucker Carlson are now calling Sidney Powell's conspiraty theory into doubt.

      Philip Rucker of The Washington Post reports that Trump has been very reluctant to agree to the General Services Administration (GSA) allowing the Biden transition to take place, since that implies a concession on the part of the president.
      There have been calls from Republican senators, and an open letter from national security veterans calling on the Trump administration to let the Biden transition begin.
      Stephen A. Schwarzman, the CEO of The Blackstone Group, "who is perhaps president Trump's closest ally in the business community", publicly said that Biden had won the election and that the country needed to move on.
      This allowed Trump's advisers to convince the president to allow the transition to begin.

        <i class="website">Houston Chronicle</i>, 08.01.2021.
        <br />On 6 January, Ted Cruz was still defending Donald Trump in the Senate. (In 2016, Cruz had called Trump a “narcissist,” a “pathological liar” and “utterly amoral”.)
        Cruz claimed in the Senate that <q>since nearly 40 percent of Americans believed the November election “was rigged” that the only remedy was to form an emergency task force to review the results</q>.
        He did not acknowledge that this distrust was fueled by Donald Trump's outlandish and unproven claims about voter fraud.
        At the time when rioters stormed the Capitol, a fundraising message was sent to Cruz's supporters:
        <q>“Ted Cruz here,” it read. “I’m leading the fight to reject electors from key states unless there is an emergency audit of the election results. Will you stand with me?”</q>
        Cruz has supported Trump's claim of voter fraud since November but <q>insists he bears no responsibility for the deadly terror attack.</q>

        <q>This accurately describes the overarching political reality in the United States:</q>
        <br />Quoting a tweet by Michael Tracey (mtracey) from 09.01.2021:
        <q cite="https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1347778321556402183">The new corporate authoritarian liberal-left monoculture is going to be absolutely ruthless -- and in 12 days it is merging with the state. This only the beginning</q>
        <br />Glenn Greenwald's follow-up tweets:
        <q cite="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348245625805172742">I wouldn't be surprised if one of the first acts of the new Dem Congress is a Resolution of Gratitude to Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook & Google execs for their patriotic censorship of Trump, Parler & other Terrorists, with encouragement to continue the anti-Terror fight.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348246215687692291">Ever since FB & Twitter's censorship orgy, all we heard is it's no big deal. Liberals invoked the libertarian mantra that private corporations can do what they want, you can just build a competitor if you don't like it. But you can't: they're monopolies.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348246541832777729">t was a *Democratic-controlled* House sub-committee that just a few months ago issued a lengthy report concluding that FB, Amazon, Google & Apple are *monopolies*. That means competition is impossible. Now Dems are happy that it's used for them:</q>

        (by Kate Cox, <i class="website">Ars Technica</i>, 07.10.2020).
        <br />Greenwald continues:
        <q cite"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348246976698208259">I've been resisting the conclusion that this is Liberals' 9/11 because it at first seemed hyperbolic, even though they're using the same weapons against their critics (if you question all the new powers they want, it means you love the Terrorists).
        <br />But this is Liberals' 9/11.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348249541745766400">For anyone who thinks "Liberals' 9/11" is hyperbolic, not only are Biden &amp; people like @NormOrnstein
       demanding new anti-terrorism laws (applied domestically), but liberals are explicitly analogizing the Capitol breach to 9/11. It doesn't take inferences:</q>
       quoting a tweet by Seth Masket (political scientist, University of Denver):
       <q cite="https://twitter.com/smotus/status/1348244752144109568">Imagine 9/11, only no press conferences explaining what happened or what was ongoing, and a third of Congress expressing sympathy with Al Qaida and urging us to forget the attack in the name of unity.</q>

        <q>On January 6, armed Trumpist militias will be rallying in DC, at Trump's orders. It's highly likely that they'll try to storm the Capitol after it certifies Joe Biden's win. I don't think this has sunk in yet.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341016990903922695">These people are angry at the Democrats. They're angry at the GOP for not suspending democracy. They hate the media, and many consider police to be the enemy even as they fly the "blue lives" flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341017615326703621">They are convinced that Congress will, somehow, declare Trump the winner on Jan 6. Maybe Pence will just refuse to count the Electoral Votes from states Biden won? Or the Senate will throw those votes out? Or Justice Thomas? Alternatively...</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341017969841811456">...some think Trump will win because *they* will ensure it. Maybe by forcing Congress to certify him as the winner at gunpoint. Maybe as backup forces to Trump's supposed military coup.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341018433232777220">When Congress certifies Biden, these people will be shocked. Their worlds will collapse. And it'll happen while they're (illegally) armed and gathered in DC. It's the nitroglycerine of explosive mixtures.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341019133668978690">How will January 6 be policed? We've already seen that the White House can effectively commandeer the DC police, and construct ad-hoc paramilitary forces out of prison officers and CBP. Will Congress get the protection it needs?</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341020110807584770">The Capitol Police has 2200 officers, but I'm guessing they mostly aren't riot trained or SWAT types. The question here is if federal forces will be *allowed* to help them.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341020685641113600">To be clear here, I don't think the 3%ers, Proud Boys, Oathkeepers or boogaloo types are going to seize the Capitol. But some of them are going try. And people will die.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341021591493353475">How will US Conservatives react? Well, they made Kyle Rittenhouse into a hero. They ignored the Whitmer kidnap plot, except as a way of calling for more violence against her.</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341025022601781249">I note that @Robertwaldeck reckons I'm completely wrong here and that DC forces including the Capitol Police, DC police and Nat Guard, which he knows well, will be able to keep things completely under control.</q>

        <q>THREAD. I am failing to see any better path for Trump apart from resignation. (Yes, I know you will say, "He'll never do that" but also did you ever think three days ago that he'd be impeached twice?) Here's me as HIS (competent) lawyer:</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347779310296424450">2. You will be impeached. Your goal now is to avoid criminal liability, and, if possible, jail time. If you resign now, you avoid several unpleasant possibilities. For one, you make the potential for an invocation of the 25th amendment, on the basis that you are CRAZY, moot</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347779727336087552">3. If you resign, and Mike Pence becomes President, he will likely give you a limited, but nevertheless broad, pardon. If he emulates Ford's pardon for Nixon, you will be pardoned for (at the very least) obstruction of justice in the Mueller investigation</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347780271488249859">4. He MAY be able to give you a pardon for crimes committed BEFORE you took office, such as your campaign finance violation, or whatever sketchy financial crimes you committed, but that is touch and go. There is *some* ambiguity over whether such a "blanket" pardon is valid BUT</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347780774142078978">5. You could also mitigate this by being frank with him and allowing him to be as specific as possible on your prior criminal liability in the pardoning language (like financial crimes re taxes, etc.). He is, however, unlikely to pardon you for inciting insurrection BECAUSE...</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347781100295348224">6. You literally almost got him killed and he hates you for that, plus he has political ambitions. But here, the real outcome is that no one wants to see you in public office ever again. SO, there are a couple of possibilities:</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347781785388777474">7. After impeachment, the Senate may convict you and then vote to prohibit you from holding public office. You know what, screw them, right? Haha. (cough) So...the other possibility is that alternatively/addition to, you get investigated for and charged for inciting insurrection</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347782351519182849">8. BUT if you plead guilty to  Rebellion and Insurrection INSTEAD, *and* AGREE not to hold public office again, they MIGHT grant you a deal, with no jail time! That sounds good, huh? *awkward encouraging laugh*</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347782836145827840">9. *clears throat* So here's the problem. You have to show that you take some kind of responsibility. Some remorse. Resigning now does that. THAT is what helped Nixon. He resigned. Prosecuting him after that just seemed a little extra, you know?</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347783509079961600">10. You at least give your allies some basis to argue, enough is enough! He did the same thing as Nixon!  But *ominous music* you are facing a potentially far worse fate. For one thing, your only option is to pardon yourself</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347784295017029632">11. This is very risky, because it will basically guarantee that you will be prosecuted for SOMETHING when you leave office, as Asha Rangappa so eloquently argued in The Washington Post (Grinning face)</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347784735100182530">12. Plus, you will have absolutely NO good faith argument to suggest that you have already incurred enough of a punishment (resigning/accepting accountability + not ever running for public office again) to justify leniency as a former POTUS</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347785029938720768">13. And you'll be totally screwed because if SCOTUS rules against you the feds will TOTALLY nail your ass and the States are going to get you anyway. <br />So what do you think?</q>
        <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347787961849569280">14. P.S. My assistant tells me there is a red eye to Moscow at 11:42 p.m. from Dulles and there is no extradition treat + Putin welcomes foreign heads of state to make their residence there. My job is to advise you of all your options.</q>

        <q>“I would like a pardon from the President of the United States.”<br />
          Dallas area realtor Jenna Ryan is the 2nd D.C. riot participant to ask for one. She flew on a private jet to D.C. to “stop the steal.” FBI arrested her today.
          She says: I feel persecuted.</q>
        <br />The tweet includes a short video. One of David Begnaud's follow-up tweets says,
        <q cite="https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1350514152066801664">I didn’t see this until now: Dallas area realtor &amp; life Coach Jenna Ryan declared “we are armed and dangerous”.
        She’s since been arrested by the FBI and is now asking President Trump for a pardon, saying he’s the reason they went there to “stop the steal”</q>

        <q>The frightening fact is that if Trump stood before the cameras and honestly confessed to his lies, his diehard supporters would just conclude he’d been brainwashed by the deep state. He couldn’t undo the harm  he’s done if he tried</q>
        <br />One of the responses to this tweet cites Gary Kasparov's tweet from 06.07.2018:
        <q cite="https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1015243974020247558">The demagogue doesn't lead radicals, he radicalizes his supporters. With each outrage he drags them down by association until they feel they have no one else, and no one else will have them. It works.</q>
        <br />On 15.0!.2018, Gary Kasparov (@Kasparov63) also wrote
        <q cite="https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1029507463085584384">(&hellip;) Is there anything Trump could say that would lose the supporters he has left? He is what they follow, not anything he stands for or says or does.</q>
        and
        <q cite="https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1029508468418342912">That's why demagoguery is so dangerous historically. When followers are so loyal to a person—not to principles or policies or even a party—there is no need to convince them of anything, only to give orders.</q>

      Not even YouTube is profitable, so any alternatives would be vastly better than YouTube.
      Vimeo has been around as long as YouTube, but you need to pay [beyond a certain volume of videos]. It's for professionnals and businesses, not for the general public. It has bad SEO and a bad search engine.
      Vid.me: similar to Vessel, which was sold to Verizon. Basically a copy of YouTube; not noticeably better. They don't have videos on their homepage.
      Minds.com: Its interface doesn't make sense; SEO is absent; videos are listed as "posts". It looks more like an imitation of Facebook with monetisation functionality from YouTube.

      "We are living through a postmodern era in which the grand narratives of religion and political ideology have collapsed. In their place have emerged a crusading desire to right perceived wrongs and a weaponization of identity, both accelerated by the new forms of social and news media. Narrow sets of interests now dominate the agenda as society becomes more and more tribal – and, as Murray shows, the casualties are mounting."

      The origin of the wide-spread idea that vitamin C can cure your cold was a book by Linus Pauling ("Vitamin C and the Common Cold").
      Adults need between 75 and 90 mg of vitamin C per day, and the vitamin can be found in many foods.
      Pauling recommended taking 2000 mg per day, but studies did not find that vitamin C does not shorten a cold significantly.
      2000 mg vitamin C per day increases the risk of diarrhoea and kidney stones.
      Vitamin C is most helpful for people engaged in intense physical exercise, for example marathon runners.
      The best cure for the common cold is rest and hydration.

      Calcium supplements are potentially dangerous because the cause a spike of calcium in the blood that lasts up to eight hours. This increases the risk of blood cots and cardiovascular problems.
      Adults need 500-700 mg of calcium daily. There are a number of vegan sources of calcium, for example: 
      100g of kale contains 139 mg of calcium, 1 cup of collard greens contains 357 grams of calcium, 100g of calcium set tofu contains 350 mg of calcium,
      30 g of almonds contain 75 mg of calcium, 100g of chia seeds contains 631 g of calcium and 1 cup of steamed bok choy contains 158 mg of calcium.
      Calcium-fortified plant milks can also be helpful, e.g. soy, oat and almond milk. The human body absorbs the calcium from soy milk just as well as from cow's milk.
      (See the study "Calcium absorption in Australian osteopenic post-menopausal women: (...)" by Tang, Walter et al, 2010: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=20460239 .)
      The ideal sources of calcium are low-oxalate dark green vegetables (except spinach, Swiss chards and beet greens, which contain few calcium that we can absorb).
      These are better sources than fortified milks because they are not processed foods without added sodium salt; they also provide fiber, folate and potassium.
      Drinking fortified milks is still better than talking calcium supplements, because they don't cause huge spikes in calcium levels in the blood.

    * "Do Not Eat Peanut Butter Again, Until You Watch This...",  Dr. Eric Berg DC
      First, the peanut's shell can easily absorb what's in the soil, and since peanuts are heavily sprayed, they absorb a lot of the pesticides, herbicides, fungicides etcetera that are sprayed on them.
      Second, in the USA, peanuts are not GMO but they are crop-rotated with cotton, which has been genetically modified to resist glyphosate (in Roundup). So glyphosate ends up in peanuts.
      When glyphosate started to be used, there was also a spike in peanut allergies, which may not be a coincidental.
      Third, aflatoxin is a poisonous carcinogen produced by certain molds that grow on peanuts (and some other plants); this toxin causes liver cancer.
      Fourth, peanut butter often contains a lot of sugar.
      However, Dr. Berg also mentions positive things about peanut butter.
      First, there is a type of peanut batter called "valencia", which has the lowest amount of aflotoxins.
      Second, when you buy organic peanut butter, you get fewer chemicals such as pesticides and fungicides.
      Third, when peanuts are roasted or germinated, you increase the availability of the nutrients.
      Fourth, chlorophyl can reduce the aflotoxin, so if you consume some salad or other plant containing chlorophyl, you reduce the aflotoxin.
      Fifth, peanuts are comparable in nutritional value to other nuts; they also contain protein.

      It is because must bodies the doctor examines are much too alkaline. Check the symptoms for acidosis versus alkalosis.
      High stress (cortisol) makes your body more alkaline, which then blocks the absorption of calcium (symptoms: twitching in the eye, cramping in the calf, neuritis).
      You also lose potassium, which makes the body even more alkaline.
      People who consume a lot of protein (e.g. protein shakes) also have guanidine (a waste product), which can cause twitching, nerve pain and arthritis. Apple cider vinegar flushes out the guanidine.

      Looks at the study "Vinegar Intake Reduces Body Weight, Body Fat Mass, and Serum Triglyceride Levels in Obese Japanese Subjects" by Tomoo Kondo, Mikiya Kishi, et al (Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 73.8 (2009).
      The study involved only obese subjects, so the results may not extrapolate to lean healthy subjects.
      He also mentions "Influence of tolerability of vinegar as a oral source of short-chain fatty acids on appetite control and food intake" by J. Darzi et al (Internationnal Journal of Obesity, 2013).
      The most important effect of vinegar is that it can lower blood sugar. See the study "Vinegar consumption can attenuate postprandial glucose and insulin responses; a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials" by Farideh Shishebor et al (Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice, 2017).
      Nippard points out that the beneficial effects are generally larger in subjects with diabetese or insulin resistance.
      He adds that "apple cider vinegar's antiglycemic effect is dependent on the type of carbohydrate you're consuming":
      "It is more effective when taken with complex carbohydrates, and it does not seem to work at all in response to simple sugar consumption" [sugar should be avoid anyhow].
      He says that this is due to the fact that "apple cider vinegar seems to work by inhibiting starch digestion, so it will be most effective when you're eating starchy, complex carbohydrates".
