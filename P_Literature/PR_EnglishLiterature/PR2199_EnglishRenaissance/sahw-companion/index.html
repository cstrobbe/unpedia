    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This collection of web resources serves as a &ldquo;companion&rdquo; to the
      <abbr title="massive open online course">MOOC</abbr>
      <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeare-and-his-world">Shakespeare and His World</a>.
      The course was created by Professor 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Bate">Jonathan Bate</a> (Warwick University)
      in co-operation with the 
      <a href="http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/">Shakespeare Birthplace Trust</a>.
      Jonathan Bate is the <abbr>MOOC</abbr>'s lead educator, and he is sometimes joined
      by Jennifer Reid of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.
    </p>
    <p>The course ran for the first time in Marchâ€“May 2014 and had around 11,000 registered learners
      (see <a href="http://www.wbs.ac.uk/news/join-us-in-celebrating-450-years-of-shakespeare/">Join us in celebrating 450 years of Shakespeare</a>,
      Warwick Business School, 02 September 2014).
      The <abbr>MOOC</abbr> had its fifth run on FutureLearn from 20 March till 27 May 2017;
      some of the participants are taking the course for the second or third time,
      for the quality of the course content itself, the lively and interesting comments or both.
      At the time of writing, it is not clear whether the course will be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>The <abbr>MOOC</abbr> is a <strong>10-week course</strong>, with each week focusing on a specific theme.
      Each week is subdivided in &ldquo;steps&rdquo;: one or two introductory steps;
      six steps with a video that presents an object, usually from the collections of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust;
      an assessment that consists of 12 multiple-choice questions;
      a discussion step where learners can comment on their favourite object of the week;
      and a summary step with a video in which Jonathan Bate and Jennifer Reid discuss certain themes
      and ideas from the week. 
      Except for the assessments, each step has a <strong>comments</strong> section. The number of comments
      in each step varies between just a few dozen and several hundreds. 
      Many of these comments contain links to other interesting resources. 
      They also contain enough book recommendations to break anyone's book-buying budget. 
      <br />You can see the 
      <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/shakespeare-and-his-world/0/steps/257">first step of the first week</a>
      (without the comments, which are not public) on the FutureLearn website.

    </p>
    <p>
      Weeks 2 to 9 have a <strong>focus play</strong>, and the objects presented in the videos are used
      to illustrate certain excerpts and themes from the plays.
      It is a good idea, though not a requirement, to read the plays before the start of the week.
      For those learners who don't have the time to read the entire plays,
      Jonathan Bate provides a list of four or five scenes that are important to read in the context of the course.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Shakespeare's plays</strong> can be read online, for example on the following websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://opensourceshakespeare.org/">Open Source Shakespeare</a>,
        a website that does not only contain most of Shakespeare's works but also
        advanced search functions and a concordance.
        This is the electronic edition recommended by Jonathan Bate.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Foyer/plays/">Plays and Poems</a> 
        on the website &ldquo;Internet Shakespeare Editions&rdquo; hosted at the University of Victoria in Canada
        and possibly the oldest Shakespeare website that is still online.
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/">The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>,
        a website hosting the digital <i class="booktitle">Complete Moby(tm) Shakespeare</i>.
        (See <a href="http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/info/moby_shakespeare.php">How Moby Shakespeare Took Over the Internet</a>
        for more background about this edition.)
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.bartleby.com/70/">The Oxford Shakespeare</a>,
        a digitised version of the edition prepared by W. J. Craig and originally published in 1914 (and therefore outdated).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, since Shakespeare's works contain many words, expressions and allusions that
      are obscure to most modern readers, it is a good idea to read a thoroughly <strong>annotated
      edition</strong> of each play. There is a wide choice of annotated editions, for example
      (in no particular order):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/academic/academic-subjects/drama-and-performance-studies/the-arden-shakespeare/">The Arden Shakespeare</a>,
