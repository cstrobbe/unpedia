                was summoned to the Wuhan Public Security Bureau where he was told to sign an official confession and admonition letter promising to cease spreading false "rumors" regarding the coronavirus.
                In the letter, he was accused of "making false comments" that had "severely disturbed the social order".
                The letter stated, "We solemnly warn you: If you keep being stubborn, with such impertinence, and continue this illegal activity, you will be brought to justice—is that understood?"
                Dr. Li signed the confession writing: "Yes, I understand."</q>

            <br />Public-health experts had questioned the <abbr>UK</abbr>'s plan to deal with the epidemic by <q>slowing but not necessarily stopping epidemic spread</q>.
            The plan consisted in allowing the virus to spread younger age groups, who are said to be less at risk for developing serious health problems,
            while protecting the old and the immunocompromised. However, relying on herd immunity, which would cost around 250,000 in the <abbr>UK</abbr>, turned out to be unfeasible.
            For this reason, the <abbr>UK</abbr> will take measures similar to those in other countries, relying on social distancing, isolation of infected individuals, and school and university closures.

            <br /><abbr>SARS-CoV</abbr>-2 is not airborne but can survive up to three hours in droplets in the air,
            on copper surfaces, the virus can survive up to four hours, on cardboard up to 24 hours (although it is unlikely that packages or mail can transmit the virus),
            on plastic and stainless steel the virus can survive two to three days (which is longer than the influenza virus).
            Researchers don't know yet how long the virus can survive on a phone or a phone case.
            <br />To reduce the risk of exposure, do not touch your eyes, mouth and face, wash your hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds,
            clean commonly used surfaces with disinfecting wipes and avoid non-essential travel to public places, especially at peak times.

            <!--5:00-->Covid-19 is more contagious than influenza, the percentage of infected people who develop a serious condition is higher,
            the percentage of infected high-risk people who need artificial respiration is considerably higher
            and the percentage of people in high-risk groups who die of the infectio is considerably higher.
            <!--6:00-->In influenza epidemics, children play a bigger role in spreading the virus, whereas, based on the current state of knowledge, all age groups infected with <abbr>SARS-CoV</abbr>-2 are equally contagious.
            In addition, there is no vaccine, nor medication, against <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus">SARS-CoV</abbr>-2

            State governors are on the front lines without federal support and the House of Representatives and the Senare are discussing which industries to rescue.
            In the mean time, East Asia (China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore) have used public health means to stop the spread of the virus.
            Sachs also comments on a statement by Dan Patrick, Texas Lieutenant Governor, who had said that there is no need for social distancing
            and that older people should sacrifice for the country's economy. The ignorance and cruelty displayed by some politicians almost leaves Jeffrey Sachs speechless.

            that it had become almost impossible for passengers to maintain a distance of 1.5 metres to other people.

              Die Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen (SSB) haben kurzfristig auf die massive Kritik von Fahrgästen an ihrem Corona-Sonderfahrplan reagiert.
              Dieser sah vor, dass seit Dienstag deutlich weniger Stadtbahnen und Busse unterwegs sind und einige Linien gar nicht bedient werden. Fahrgäste berichteten daraufhin von qualvoller Enge, die einen Mindestabstand zwischen den Fahrgästen unmöglich machte. Nun reagiert die SSB kurzfristig. Bereits ab Mittwoch sollen auf den besonders stark nachgefragten Linien zusätzliche Bahnen eingesetzt werden – und zwar im 15-Minuten-Takt, so SSB-Sprecherin Birte Schaper.
              Außerdem kündigte sie an, so kurzfristig wie möglich auch die anderen Stadtbahnlinien während der morgendlichen Hauptverkehrszeit im 15-Minuten-Takt zu bedienen.

            Other Republicans have made similar statement, including Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.

            (<i class="blog">Brian Tyler Cohen / @briantylercohen</i> on Twitter, 26.03.2020).
            <br />Political host Brian Tyler Cohen posts (or reposts) an ad by Joe Biden's presidential campaign that exposes Donald Trump's failure to properly respond to the crisis.
            This includes statements by Donald Trump that the epidemic is a new hoax by the Democrats (28 January),
            that people who are healthy will be fine (29 February), that things are working out (10 March),
            that he takes no responsibility for the fact that the lag in testing is a failing (13 March),
            that asking about his disbanding the White House pandemic office is just a nasty question (13 March),
            that on a scale of 1 to 10, he rates his response to the crisis with a 10 (16 March, by which date, 4466 infections had been reported in the <abbr>U.S.A.</abbr>),
            and that he inherited a broken, obsolete system (22 March).

            <q><abbr>EPA</abbr>'s temporary enforcement discretion policy applies to civil violations during the COVID-19 outbreak. The policy addresses different categories of noncompliance differently.
            For example, under the policy <abbr>EPA</abbr> does not expect to seek penalties for noncompliance with routine monitoring and reporting obligations that are the result of the COVID-19 pandemic but does expect operators of public water systems to continue to ensure the safety of our drinking water supplies.
            (&hellip;) To be eligible for enforcement discretion, the policy also requires facilities to document decisions made to prevent or mitigate noncompliance and demonstrate how the noncompliance was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
            (&hellip;) <abbr>EPA</abbr>'s policy will apply retroactively beginning on March 13, 2020.</q>
