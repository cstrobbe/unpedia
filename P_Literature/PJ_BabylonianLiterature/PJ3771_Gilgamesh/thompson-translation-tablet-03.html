      <h2>The Expedition to the Forest of Cedars Against Humbaba</h2>
      <h3>Column I</h3>
      <p>(<i>About a column and a half of the beginning of the Old Babylonian version on the Yale tablet are so broken that almost all the text is lost.
        Gilgamish and Enkidu have now become devoted friends, thus strangely stultifying the purpose for which Enkidu was created, and now is set afoot the great expedition against the famous Cedar Forest guarded by the Ogre Humbaba. The courtesan has now for a brief space left the scene, having deserted Enkidu, much to his sorrow. The mutilated Assyrian Version gives a hint that the mother of Gilgamish is now describing the fight to one of her ladies(?) Rishat-Nin . . . and where her recital becomes connected the story runs thus</i>).

      <p>(<i>Columns III, IV, and V are much mutilated. There is the remnant of a passage in Assyrian, corresponding to the Third Tablet of the Old Babylonian Version, Column III, </i>15<i>, which gives Enkidu&#8217;s speech about &#8220;the mountains,&#8221; &#8220;the cattle of the field,&#8221; and how &#8220;he waited&#8221;: then follows another fragment with a mention of the &#8220;corpse&#8221; </i>[<i>of Humbaba</i>]<i> and of the Anunnaki (the Spirits of Heaven), and a repetition of the line &#8220;that strong man (who) feareth </i>[<i>thee</i>]<i> .&#8221; Then a reference to &#8220;the journey&#8221; until </i>[<i>Gilgamish shall have overthrown the fierce Humbaba</i>]<i>, be it after an interval of days, months, or years; and another fragment probably part of the previous text, where someone &#8220;heaps up incense&#8221; </i>[<i>to a god</i>]<i>, and Enkidu again speaks with someone, but the mutilated text does not allow us much light on its connection, and although there is another fragment, the connection again is not obvious. The last column is a repetition of what the Elders said to Gilgamish</i>):</p>

      <p><a name="fn_46"></a><a href="#fr_50">20:1</a> Down to this point the: Assyrian Version has been used, restored in part from the Old Babylonian. The Old Babylonian Version runs (Column II. 26 &#8220;The eyes [of Enkidu fill'd] with tears, his heart was [heavy] and . . . he mourned, his heart [was heavy], and . . . he mourn &#8216;d. [Gilgamish] lifted up his face, [spake] to Enkidu: &#8216; [Why] are thine eyes [full of tears] (and) thy [heart heavy]? [Why dost thou] mourn?&#8217; [Enkidu answer'd] and spake to Gilgamish:&#8221; and then it continues as above in the text.</p>
      <p><a name="fn_47"></a><a href="#fr_51">20:2</a> A difficult phrase. It may be that this represents the words for saying farewell, without any further explanation, just as our &#8220;God be with you&#8221; has become, &#8220;Good-bye.&#8221; The same convention is apparent in Ruth 1, 14, at the parting of the two daughters of Naomi: &#8220;And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth clave unto her.&#8221;</p>
