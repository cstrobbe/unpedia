          <br />Among other things, Chomsky says that Bernie Sanders's campaign was amazing, since few people knew him,
          he used the word &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; and did not rely on corporate money.
          Alan Greenspan, who has been hailed as one of the greatest economists in American history,
          has said that the economic growth he was praised for was based on growing worker insecurity.
          Many of Trump's voters could have voted for Sanders.

          (<i class="ytchannel"><abbr>MSNBC</abbr></i> on YouTube, 8 minutes, 16.09.2017).
          <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McWhorter">John McWorther</a>, professor of linguistics at Columbia University,
          says that Donald Trump speaks as if he had had no education. Even in formal circumstances, he never leaves the realm of the casual.
          He likes to say <q>people don't know</q> when he means &ldquo;I have just learnt&rdquo; because he has the psychological need to be seen as the alpha male.
          He appears to use &ldquo;believe me&rdquo; and similar phrases when he runs out of ideas, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> where other people say &ldquo;uhm&rdquo;.
          He doesn't have a <q>more responsible sense of truth</q> and has alwasy been <q>numb to the artful</q>;
          instead he has a <q>narcotic joy in dismissal and belittlement rather than building and decorating<q>.
          Trump is clinically narcissistic and always talking rather than speaking.

          (<i class="ytchannel">The Humanist Report</i> on YouTube, 13 minutes, 20.09.2018).
          <br />In an interview on <abbr>CNN</abbr>, Jake Tapper asks Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez what corporate media always ask politicians promoting Medicare for All: <q>How do you pay for it?</q>
          They never ask this question to politicians promoting war; they only ask this about policies that specifically benefit the American people.
          1:04: Jake Tapper begins by presenting the "Dem socialist price tag": $32 trillion for Medicare for All, $5.4 on jobs guarantee, $1.4 on student loans and $1.3 on free college, paid family leave and Social Security expansion,
          totalling over $40 trillion over the next decade. Raising taxes on the very wealthy and increasing corporate tax rates would raise $2 trillion over the next decade,
          so Tapper asks where the other $38 trillion will come from.
          1:20: AOC points out that Medicare for All would save the American people a very large amount of money and that many of the suggested policies have been "accomplished by every modern civilised democracy in the western world".

          (<i class="ytchannel"><abbr>CBS</abbr> News</i> on YouTube, 12 minutes, 11.11.2020).
          <br />Joe Biden's transition team has not been allowed to start the transition proces by the White House.
          Mike Pompeo said there would be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration.
          In the mean time, several world leaders have congratulated Joe Biden with the election result.
          Four Republican senators have referred to Biden as the president elect: Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Ben Sasse.
          Other Republican senaors have admitted privately that Joe Biden won the election but refuse to do so publicly.
          When asked whether there was any fraud in their race, senators Joni Ernst and Steve Dains said she didn't believe so.
          Other senators said they didn't know and/or that the courts should decide about that: Mike Rounds (South Dakota) and
          Mitch McConnell (Kentucky). However, their were no accusations of fraud from senators who lost their races.

          <i class="website">The Ring of Fire</i>, 28.11.2020.
          <br />For the 2016 presidential election campaign, mainstream media gave Donald Trump two billion dollars' worth of media coverage.
          Now they are covering Donald Trump's soft coup because that attracts lots of viewers and thereby a lot of advertising revenue.
          In the mean time, other important themes, such as climate change, are ignored.
          After Biden's inauguration, they will probably let Donald Trump and his supporters in the Republican party phone in or give them screentime without factchecking what they say.
          Corporate networks serve corporate masters, not the American people, its viewers.

          (<i class="ytchannel">The Hill</i> on YouTube, 8 minutes, 11.12.2020).
          <br />According to Jimmy Dore, the (real) progressives should withhold their vote for Nancy Pelosi as speaker until she puts Medicare for All to the vote.
          On a previous re-election of Nance Pelosi as speaker, other Democrats had forced her to move to the right.
          Jimmy Dore has also often explained to progressives that the Democratic establishment hates them more than the Republicans.
          (The Democratic establishment first eliminated Bernie Sanders from the presidential primaries before taking on Donald Trump.)
          On the other hand, Democrats who supported Medicare for All got re-elected to the House or the Senate.
          <br />Jimmy Dore's idea would later trend under the hashtag <code>#ForceTheVote</code>.

          The Supreme Court should not have decided that the counting of ballots can continue after 3 November becuase, according to Trump, this increases the risk of fraud.
          As soon as the election is over, Trump's lawyers will check (what exactly?). He especially wants to prevent a Democratic victory in Pennsylvania.
          He claims, 2:39, "everyone knows what happens in Philadelphia, you don't have to say it, but I've read about it for years. And I don't think it's fair that we have to wait a long period of time after the election.
          If people wanted to get their ballots in, they should have gotten their ballots in long before that, [a] long time."
          However, Trump had made sure that the ballots would show up late.

      The big networks are waiting to declare Biden's victory in the presidential election. Fox News called Arizona for Biden before any other network did.
      The Associated Press then followed Fox. The New York Times has still not declared Arizona as won for Biden.
      Donald Trump called Rupert Murdoch to complain about this. Rupert Murdoch informed Trump that he had lost.
      There are also news reports about Rupert Murdoch calling Mitch McConnell and telling not to feed Trump's conspiracy theories.
      2:00: Hartmann's theory is that all the networks are waiting for Fox to declare Biden as the winner,
      "because Fox has the greatest credibility to call the election for Biden right now, given that Fox has been the cheerleader for Trump for five years."
      If Fox calls the election first, Trump can't call the other networks "fake news".

      The election is over, even if Trump should win the recount in Georgia, which is unlikely. Biden will probably win the popular vote by 5%.
      The Democrats were projected to win back the Senate, but it does not look like this will happen.
      They also lost four seats in the House of Representatives.
      Each Democrat who supported Medicare for All was re-elected, including Democrats in swing districts.
      By contrast, several right-wing Democrats lost their seats. Katie Porter, a left-wing Democrat in a swing district, cruised the re-election.
      However, the Democratic establishment try to push the opposite idea: namely that left-wing ideas cause the party to underperform.
      Ilhan Omar, another left-wing Democrat, Ilhan Omar and Rashid Tlaib increased turnout, which in turn helped win Biden Minnesota and Michican, respectively.
      John Kasich in Ohio endorsed Biden, who got obliterated by Trump in Ohio.
      AOC should not call for unifying with the Democratic establishment but attack them for their corruption.
      If the polls had been correct, Joe Biden would have won 351 electoral votes, but he lost North Carolina and Florida.
      Biden underperformed in several states he was supposed to win.
      Kyle Kulinski's worst-case was that Biden would win 321 electoral votes, but Biden did still worse than that.
      The Democrats can't do any better because they don't stand for anything.
      For example, in Florida, there was a direct-ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage, which got 60% of the votes.
      In spite of this, Donald Trump still beat Joe Biden by at least three points in Florida, because Joe Biden had neglected to talk about minimum wage in his speeches and interviews.
      The Democrats did not even manage to win against Mitch McConnell, who blocked a huge stimulus package.
      Stating that they are "not Donald Trump" is not enough for Democrats to decisively win election.
      11:18: Bernie Sanders would have won much more comfortably, winning Ohio and Iowa against Trump.
      However, the Democrats refuse to learn from this, since they are already blaming the left for their poor performance.

      Attorney Sidney Powell claims that the Republican governor of Georgia is involved in a scheme with the CIA to make Trump lose in Georgia so he can benefit from election insurance set up by Hugo Chavez, who died in 2013.
      Whereas Republicans publicly claim that the presidential election was stolen by means of voter fraud, Trump's legal team makes no claims of voter fraud in court.
      In court, Trump's legal team makes it clear that what they are alleging has nothing to do with fraud.
      For example, in a Pennsylvania federal case, Giuliani that "this is not a fraud case". In a state case in Pennsylvania, Trump lawyer Jonathan S. Goldstein
      denied that he was accusing anybody of fraud. In Maricopa Count, Arizona, Trump attorney Kory Langhofer said he was not alleging fraud or even that there were glitches in the voting machines.
      In a court in Nevada, Trump lawyers did not allege fraud eiter; instead, they focus on much smaller claims.
      Even Trump supporters such as Tucker Carlson are now calling Sidney Powell's conspiraty theory into doubt.

      Philip Rucker of The Washington Post reports that Trump has been very reluctant to agree to the General Services Administration (GSA) allowing the Biden transition to take place, since that implies a concession on the part of the president.
      There have been calls from Republican senators, and an open letter from national security veterans calling on the Trump administration to let the Biden transition begin.
      Stephen A. Schwarzman, the CEO of The Blackstone Group, "who is perhaps president Trump's closest ally in the business community", publicly said that Biden had won the election and that the country needed to move on.
      This allowed Trump's advisers to convince the president to allow the transition to begin.

          <br />Description: <q>A fascinating focus group with Trump voters is conducted by Frank Luntz, and we discuss the implications about deprogramming Trumpists</q>.
          All except one of the twelve Trump voters in the video believes that the election was stolen.
          These voters got their news from Fox; at least one of them got his news from Newsmax and Breitbart because he saw Fox sliding to the left.
          One of them says that she lives in Washington and that it was hell, apparently without realising that it was because of the riot incited by Trump that led to the extra security.
          One of the voters gave up on Trump because he failed to handle to Covd-19 pandemic appropriately and because he threw Mike Pence under the bus.
          In all, only one of the twelve Trump voters turned away from Trump.

          <q>On January 6, armed Trumpist militias will be rallying in DC, at Trump's orders. It's highly likely that they'll try to storm the Capitol after it certifies Joe Biden's win. I don't think this has sunk in yet.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341016990903922695">These people are angry at the Democrats. They're angry at the GOP for not suspending democracy. They hate the media, and many consider police to be the enemy even as they fly the "blue lives" flag instead of the Stars and Stripes.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341017615326703621">They are convinced that Congress will, somehow, declare Trump the winner on Jan 6. Maybe Pence will just refuse to count the Electoral Votes from states Biden won? Or the Senate will throw those votes out? Or Justice Thomas? Alternatively...</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341017969841811456">...some think Trump will win because *they* will ensure it. Maybe by forcing Congress to certify him as the winner at gunpoint. Maybe as backup forces to Trump's supposed military coup.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341018433232777220">When Congress certifies Biden, these people will be shocked. Their worlds will collapse. And it'll happen while they're (illegally) armed and gathered in DC. It's the nitroglycerine of explosive mixtures.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341019133668978690">How will January 6 be policed? We've already seen that the White House can effectively commandeer the DC police, and construct ad-hoc paramilitary forces out of prison officers and CBP. Will Congress get the protection it needs?</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341020110807584770">The Capitol Police has 2200 officers, but I'm guessing they mostly aren't riot trained or SWAT types. The question here is if federal forces will be *allowed* to help them.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341020685641113600">To be clear here, I don't think the 3%ers, Proud Boys, Oathkeepers or boogaloo types are going to seize the Capitol. But some of them are going try. And people will die.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341021591493353475">How will US Conservatives react? Well, they made Kyle Rittenhouse into a hero. They ignored the Whitmer kidnap plot, except as a way of calling for more violence against her.</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1341025022601781249">I note that @Robertwaldeck reckons I'm completely wrong here and that DC forces including the Capitol Police, DC police and Nat Guard, which he knows well, will be able to keep things completely under control.</q>

          <q>A video by Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, showed Trump and members of his inner circle dancing, smiling, and watching television screens inside a private tent at Ellipse Park near the White House on Jan. 6, 2021.

          (<i class="ytchannel">The Humanist Report</i> on YouTube, 7 minutes, 08.01.2021).
          <br />According to Mike Figueredo, antifa supporters always wear masks, while Trump's supporters refuse to wear masks.
          There is also evidence, such as merchandise, that the rioters were right-wing.
          Matt Gaetz's comment that Democrats are now not shouting to defund the police doesn't make sense because
          (1) it's only a small minority (perhaps five members of Congress) who support &ldquo;defend the police&rquo; and

          <q>There was a group of people who tried to warn everyone about Trump's authoritarianism. For years, we were called alarmists, accused of having "Trump Derangement Syndrome." We were right. Perhaps those who called us alarmists should now be reflecting about their own lack of alarm?</q>

          <q>THREAD. I am failing to see any better path for Trump apart from resignation. (Yes, I know you will say, "He'll never do that" but also did you ever think three days ago that he'd be impeached twice?) Here's me as HIS (competent) lawyer:</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347779310296424450">2. You will be impeached. Your goal now is to avoid criminal liability, and, if possible, jail time. If you resign now, you avoid several unpleasant possibilities. For one, you make the potential for an invocation of the 25th amendment, on the basis that you are CRAZY, moot</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347779727336087552">3. If you resign, and Mike Pence becomes President, he will likely give you a limited, but nevertheless broad, pardon. If he emulates Ford's pardon for Nixon, you will be pardoned for (at the very least) obstruction of justice in the Mueller investigation</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347780271488249859">4. He MAY be able to give you a pardon for crimes committed BEFORE you took office, such as your campaign finance violation, or whatever sketchy financial crimes you committed, but that is touch and go. There is *some* ambiguity over whether such a "blanket" pardon is valid BUT</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347780774142078978">5. You could also mitigate this by being frank with him and allowing him to be as specific as possible on your prior criminal liability in the pardoning language (like financial crimes re taxes, etc.). He is, however, unlikely to pardon you for inciting insurrection BECAUSE...</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347781100295348224">6. You literally almost got him killed and he hates you for that, plus he has political ambitions. But here, the real outcome is that no one wants to see you in public office ever again. SO, there are a couple of possibilities:</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347781785388777474">7. After impeachment, the Senate may convict you and then vote to prohibit you from holding public office. You know what, screw them, right? Haha. (cough) So...the other possibility is that alternatively/addition to, you get investigated for and charged for inciting insurrection</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347782351519182849">8. BUT if you plead guilty to  Rebellion and Insurrection INSTEAD, *and* AGREE not to hold public office again, they MIGHT grant you a deal, with no jail time! That sounds good, huh? *awkward encouraging laugh*</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347782836145827840">9. *clears throat* So here's the problem. You have to show that you take some kind of responsibility. Some remorse. Resigning now does that. THAT is what helped Nixon. He resigned. Prosecuting him after that just seemed a little extra, you know?</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347783509079961600">10. You at least give your allies some basis to argue, enough is enough! He did the same thing as Nixon!  But *ominous music* you are facing a potentially far worse fate. For one thing, your only option is to pardon yourself</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347784295017029632">11. This is very risky, because it will basically guarantee that you will be prosecuted for SOMETHING when you leave office, as Asha Rangappa so eloquently argued in The Washington Post (Grinning face)</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347784735100182530">12. Plus, you will have absolutely NO good faith argument to suggest that you have already incurred enough of a punishment (resigning/accepting accountability + not ever running for public office again) to justify leniency as a former POTUS</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347785029938720768">13. And you'll be totally screwed because if SCOTUS rules against you the feds will TOTALLY nail your ass and the States are going to get you anyway. <br />So what do you think?</q>
          <br /><q cite="https://twitter.com/AshaRangappa_/status/1347787961849569280">14. P.S. My assistant tells me there is a red eye to Moscow at 11:42 p.m. from Dulles and there is no extradition treat + Putin welcomes foreign heads of state to make their residence there. My job is to advise you of all your options.</q>

          <br />Quote:
          <q>In the days before a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol building on Wednesday, President Donald Trump's political apparatus worked behind the scenes with pro-Trump groups to plan and promote events in Washington, D.C., that ultimately led to Wednesday's attack on Congress.</q>
          A permit for the march on 6 January was submitted by the non-profit organisation &ldquo;Women for America First&rdquo;, which was founded in 2019.
          However, <q>behind the scenes White House staff and close allies of the president, including former Trump campaign staff, worked with the organizers to plan and promote the events on Wednesday that would ultimately erupt into the deadly storming of the Capitol, sources said.</q>

          (<i class="ytchannel">The Humanist Report</i> on YouTube, 23 minutes, 09.01.2021).
          <br />For example, Trump supporters believe that in Pennsylvania there were more votes than people who voted.
          It does not occur to them that if the Democrats wanted to manipulate the election, they would have secured the Senate without run-off elections in Georgia.
          They believe that they are saving democracy instead of helping Donald Trump steal the election.
          This problem will exist as long as Republican politicians support Trump's lies about the election.
          <br />On the day of the insurrection, several interviewees did not consider the rioters violent or Trump's behaviour inappropriate for a president.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io2jTkyYxj0">Ex-Trump press secretary Sean Spicer says impeachment 'isn’t going anywhere’</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Sky News</i> on YouTube, 7 minutes, 11.01.2021).
          <br />Spicer, who now works for the right-wing outlet Newsmax, finds what happened on Capitol Hill troubling, disgusting and heart wrenching to watch.
          He says that the idea that the 25th amendment might be invoked as a silly discussion because nobody in the cabinet is entertaining that idead.
          The House might rush through the procedure for impeachment, but this wouldn't go anywhere because the Republicans are in control of the Senate.
          He says it is <q>purely a stunt on behalf of the Democrats</q> because <q>you shouldn't be making light or trying to make a political statement
          with what happened last week.</q> He thinks that the procedure will divinde the United States. (In other words, some people need to be held responsible,
          but not Donald Trump.)<br />
          Since the Senate will not meet again before 19 January, the impeachment procedure does not help those who are concerned about what Trump might do during his last nine days in office.
          The interviewer asks what Trump might have tried to achieve, especially in the light of the letter that the ten living former defence secretaries <q>warning the military not to get involved<q>;
          he adds <q>Do you think the president actually made an attempt, somehow, to get the military of the United States to support his ambition to stay in power?</q>
          Among other things, Sean Spicer says that what happened at the Capitol was unimaginable; attacks on the country had come from the outside (Pearl Harbor, 11 September),
          not from the inside. He avoids the question whether ten former defence secretaries had <q>gotten wind of an expected coup</q>.
          He objects to the term &ldquo;coup&rquo; and points out that the military takes an oath to the constitution, not to a leader.

            Dallas area realtor Jenna Ryan is the 2nd D.C. riot participant to ask for one. She flew on a private jet to D.C. to “stop the steal.” FBI arrested her today.

          <q cite="https://twitter.com/Kasparov63/status/1029507463085584384">(&hellip;) Is there anything Trump could say that would lose the supporters he has left? He is what they follow, not anything he stands for or says or does.</q>
