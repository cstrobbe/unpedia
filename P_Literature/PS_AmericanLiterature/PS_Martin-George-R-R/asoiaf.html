        <!-- Also the public pennance of Eleanor Cobham https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor,_Duchess_of_Gloucester - which also occurs in Shakespeare's Henry VI -->
        The Wall was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian's_Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>.
        The Knight's Watch was inspired by 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_order_%28monastic_society%29">military orders</a> such as the

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar">Knights Templar</a>.
        The Dothraki were inspired by nomadic people like the

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols">Mongols</a>.
        The Unsullied were inspired by slave armies such as the

        The Sons of the Harpy use daggers and know how to blend into the crowd after attacking people;

        (YouTube, 17 minutes, 07.06.2015).
        This video contains several factual errors. For example, it claims that the Great Wall of China is 
        20,000 kilometres long and that it was constructed in several phases,
        all Chinese names are mispronounced, and it locates the kingdom of Qin in the West of China.
        However, it also draws parallels between Robert Baratheon and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Wenxuan_of_Northern_Qi">Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi</a>,
        between Cersei Lannister and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_Dowager_Cixi">Empress Dowager Cixi</a>,
        between Aegon IV Targaryen and
        the Ming dynasty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhengde_Emperor">Zhengde Emperor</a>,
        between Joffrey Baratheon and Liu Ziye, who is also known as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Deposed_Emperor_of_Liu_Song">Emperor Qianfei of the Liu Song dynasty</a>,
        between
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rains_of_Castamere_(song)">The Rains of Castamere</a> and the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou_massacre">1645 Yangzhou massacre</a>
        (there was another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangzhou_massacre_(760)">Yangzhou massacre in 760</a>),
        and between the struggle between Cersei Lannyster and Margaery Tyrell on the one hand and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empress_L%C3%BC_Zhi">Empress Lü Zhi</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consort_Qi">Consort Qi</a> on the other.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There may be more historical inspirations than are mentioned in the above sources.
      For example, the family name
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters#House_Martell">Martell</a>
      is almost identical to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martel">Charles Martel's</a> cognomen (“hammer”; “Martell” in German).
      Charles Martel fought important battles against Islamic forces, which has a kind of parallel to Dorne's resistance against the Targaryens, who also come from the east.
      Was Robert Baratheon's war hammer inspired by Charles Martel?
    </p>
    <p>Was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhc283pXcjQ">battle of Qohor</a>,
      in which Dothraki cavalry charges again and again on the Unsullied inspired by
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tours">battle of Tours</a>,
      in which the Islamic cavalry repeatedly charged against the Frankish infantry?
      (See this YouTube video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8q0PpIUN4g">Battle of Tours/Poitiers in 732</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>The family name Lannister sounds similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lancaster">Lancaster</a>,
      one of the houses in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> in 15th-century England.
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tywin_Lannister">Tywin Lannister</a>'s first name
      looks almost identical to the name of the Welsh town
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tywyn">Tywyn</a>, but the pronunciation is quite different.
    </p>
    <p>King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV_of_England">Edward IV of England</a> (1442 – 1483)
      was a good soldier, but once he got hold of the throne, he became more interested in women (he had numerous mistresses and illegitimate children)
      and alchohol. In this respect, he is similar to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baratheon">Robert Baratheon</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Women who fight (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brienne_of_Tarth">Brienne of Tarth</a>) 
      or lead an army (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen">Daenerys Targaryen</a>)
      also figure in Shakespeare's <i class="play">Henry VI</i>:
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI,_Part_1"><i class="play">Henry VI, Part 1</i></a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc">Joan of Arc</a>
      helps lift the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Orl%C3%A9ans">Siege of Orléans</a>,
      and in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VI,_Part_3"><i class="play">Henry VI, Part 3</i></a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_of_Anjou">Queen Margaret</a>, Henry VI's wife,
      was present at some of the battles in the Wars of the Roses.
    </p>
    <p>The direwolves are based on the real
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_wolf">dire wolf (<i>Canis dirus</i>)</a>,
      which became extinct 9,000 years ago. The dire wolf was roughly the size of the largest modern gray wolf,
      but with larger teeth and a greater bite force.

        This video is not so much about season 8 of Game of Thrones but about the plot summary
        George R. R. Martin in 1993, when the author still planned writing three volumes.
        This plot summary is very different from what Martin ended up writing.
        In 1993, he wrote that the following characters would survive the story:
        Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Bran Stark, Arya Stark and Tyrion Lannister.

          What struck me when recently rewatching Season 5 Episode 10 is what a dismal failure Sam's advice to Ollie was. Ollie's question is very specific: "Why is the Lord Commander going to Hardhome to save all those Wildlings?"
          Sam's answer is so general that it is almost evasive: "Sometimes, a man has to make hard choices, choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run."
          This basically means that it may often happen that you make decisions that other people disagree with. However, both John's rationale and what Ollie was asking for was much more specific: John wants to save the Wildlings because (1) they would otherwise increase the size of the Night King's army and (2) the "living" need more people to fight against the "others".
          Sam could also explain that he had seen a white walker (and killed it) and that John had seen one (the one that took away Craster's last son). Sam could have talked about the attack by the wights at the Fist of First Men. But instead of giving very specific and factual reasons, the type that might (might!) have convinced Ollie, Sam gives him subjective ones (what is right or wrong depends on your point of view).
          I don't know what this dialogue looks like in the books, but it is an absolute failure on Sam's part.
