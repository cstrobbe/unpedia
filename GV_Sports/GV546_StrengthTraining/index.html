          for example the video
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYnx49pTqhc">Doug McGuff, <abbr>MD</abbr> on The Best Routine, Frequency of Training and Recovery for the Over-40s | <abbr>HI</abbr>Tuni</a>
          (5 minutes, 21.05.2018).
          This is about exercises that are chosen to that most of the concentration is focused on effort instead of co-ordination.
          This results in the following types of exercises:
          (1) an upper-body push in the horizontal plane, (2) an upper-body pull in the horizontal plane, (3) an upper-body push in the vertical plane, (4) an upper-body pull in the vertical plane and (5) a pressing movement with the lower body.
          You may also want a hinging movement around the hips, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> some sort of lumbar extension or a Roman chair extension, superman on the floor or even a deadlift.
          <br />These big body movements will cover most of the musculature throughout the body.
          In the beginning, you can start Monday-Wednesday-Friday and after a few days move to a Monday-Thursday frequency. If you are feeling fatigued, you can change that to Monday-Friday-Wednesday.
          Improvements don't necessarily follow the pattern workout-recovery-improvement; sometimes it follows the pattern of a few workout-recovery cycles before improvement can be seen.
          In one of the comments, HiTuni / Doug McGuff explains what the big five exercises are:
          <ul>
            <li>a lower body push, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> leg press or squat,</li>
            <li>an upper body horizontal pull, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a multi-joint row,</li>
            <li>an upper body horizontal push, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a chest press or bench press,</li>
            <li>an upper body vertical pull, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> a pulldown or chin-up.</li>
          </ul>
          Doug McGuff also answers a number of questions in the comments:
          <dl class="q-a-list">
            <dt class="question">I always hear people talk about protein synthesis and that after 48 hours your muscles stop growing and you should hit them again. But in my opinion your muscles don't start growing until their repaired.</dt>
              <dd class="answer">Muscles also don't suddenly start atrophying just because protein synthesis has returned to baseline. Just looking at protein synthesis is too narrow of a perspective.</dd>
            <dt class="question">(&hellip;) I will do a HIT routine, train to failure on all major muscle groups, but I am putting on top of that some follow up exercise because I worry that maybe I didn't really train to failure.
            I will usually try another round or two of hit later in the day, either with fewer reps top failure or with a lower weight. The maybe some isolation exercises like dumbel curls to failure. Also some negatives. (&hellip;)</dt>
              <dd class="answer">2x <abbr>HIT</abbr> workouts per week is enough resistance training, adding more will likely hinder rather than help results- and can lead to that wiped out feeling you describe. Focus on getting good at going to momentary muscular failure safely and you will have done what needs to be done!</dd>
            <dt class="question">What other workouts is he doing besides Big 5?? I can’t find anything anywhere on cardio recommendations. Is he walking? Jogging?</dt>
              <dd class="answer">As Childish Gamebino mentioned the "cardio" is in the workout. The metabolic impact of performing sets to momentary failure is akin to sprinting. Being physically active, walking etc. between HIT workouts is a good thing,
              but there is no need for a formal schedule- just be spontaneously active!</dd>

            - "German Volume Training SCIENCE For MASS", 8 minutes, 09.08.2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZkfqy4V7e0
              German volume training involves doing 10 sets of 10 reps for each exercise.
              [See also https://fitnessdoctrine.com/work-out-routines/german-volume-training/ who claims that Charles Poliquin popularised it in the 1990s.

            - "The BIGGEST Gym Mistake: INTENSITY !", 11 minutes, 07.04.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDAFAokr2RU
              You need to look at your muscle fiber dominance (type 1 or type 2).
              Those with a higher type-2-muscle fiber dominance will benefit from low-volume work, whereas type-1-dominant people will benefit from high-volume work.
              In addition the more training experience you have, the higher your intensity needs to be.
              You should use a multitude of rep ranges for hypertrophy. See Charles Poliquin (Principles) and Brad Schoenfeld.
              See also Christian Thibaudeau.
            - "The FIVE Biggest Gym MISTAKES To Avoid", 8 minutes, 01.07.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h4_evTbyQg
              1. Too many isolation exercises at the cost of compound movements.
              2. Taking your fitness advice from an influencer just because they are "successful". Or applying information from an elite bodybuilder to yourself without understanding why they do what they do.
              3. Training frequency: @@
              4. 3.40: Not timing rest periods.
              5. 5:04: No planned periodisation. You need to a changing stimulus and progressive overload. (See other video about periodisation.)
            - "Vince Del Monte vs. Shredded Sports Science", 11 minutes, 10.10.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSQaNl8cQWQ
              A few facts that Vince Del Monte was not aware of:
              e.g. [1:50] <q>The energy sources that your body uses are highly related to the intensity of training: low-intensity training will use more fat for fuel (...) and high-intensity training will use more glycogen."
              [6:33] There is a difference between lean mass and muscle mass. There is also difference between contractile and non-contractile hypertrophy.
              [See Greg Nuckols: "Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy: The Bros Were Probably Right", 17.12.2015: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/sarcoplasmic-vs-myofibrillar-hypertrophy/ ]
            - "Ashley Nocera is on a Journey To Snap City", 7 minutes, 30.04.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LOKKib2ENE
              Some of the exercises in Ashley Nocera's video can lead to injury.
            - "Can You Build Muscle With Calisthenics ONLY ?", 11 minutes, 19.05.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGCcsSNLVAQ
              Yes, you can. "You need to incorporate the base layer principles of muscle hypertrophy, focusing on progressive overload in your training and a positive energy balance or caloric surplus with your nutrition."
              Targeting some specific muscles can be difficult without weights.
              It is a good idea to use weights or machines to target, for example, the posterior chain and the rotator cuffs (face pulls).
            - "'Functional Fitness' Needs FIXING", 11 minutes, 26.05.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJArIiopiBw
              Functional training is a spectrum that depends on you and your characteristics.
            - "Are MUSCLE UPS Just A PARTY TRICK ?", 8 minutes, 02.06.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vWgA4eR7nc
              YouTube has many videos about how to do muscle ups, but very few that discuss the risks versus benefits.
              There are different types of muscle ups, e.g. pure strength based muscle ups and momentum-based muscle ups.
            - "Six Pack Machine STUPIDITY", 10 minutes, 23.07.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOd-SqZAGx0
              This video debunks so-called abs machines that are sold as devices that give you a six pack using electric stimulation (EMS).

            - "THIS MAN is the Insta Virus Star", 10 minutes, 27.09.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3rLzJBe-OI
              Bradley Martyn  is a legitimate power lifter, but he has started putting out videos showing ridiculous and even dangerous "exercices" (especially on Instagram).
            - "Functional Fitness Has FAILED YOU (Naudi Aguilar/ Barbell Backflip)", 11 minutes, 23.10.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0mObDcg0ck
              Exercises that involve multiple planes of motion are usually functional, but that does not mean that everything else is not functional.
              The fitness world should stop being so binary about functional training, since it is difficult to not classify an exercise as functional.
              Too many people demonstrate or promote exercises that are simply dangerous but which they sell as "functional", e.g. performing squats on a BOSU ball or doing backflips with a barbell.
            - "Is Scott Herman's Schoenfeld Critique Correct ?", 11 minutes, 25.11.2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jermh2fUz7E
              Scott Herman claimed that there are mus-do exercises, disagreeing or misreading an Instagram post by Dr. Brad Schoenfeld.
            - "Fitness SELLOUTS and Superset SCIENCE", 10 minutes, 17.01.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlHqbQbUZbY
              The targets this time are Jack Owoc (Bang Energy CEO) Jillian Michaels and Jim Stoppani.
              3:42: The second part of the video discusses supersets. Their main benefit is efficiency: you do more in less time.
              There are various ways in which you can do them, i.e. with regard when you have resting periods.
              4:50: If your goal is hypertrophy, then supersets are worth considering. However, if your goal is performance related, for example power or velocity, then supersets are not recommended.
              [Cf. Weakley et al: The Effects of Superset configuration on Kinetic, Kinematic, and Perceived Exertion in the Barbell Bench Press. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, August 2017
              Cf. Brentano et al: Muscle Damage and Muscle Activity Induced by Strength Training Super-Sets in Physically Active Men. Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, July 2017]
              5:15: There are two main ways to do supersets: the agonist-antagonist method and the method that relies on relies on the same similar-biomechanical movements.
              An example of an agonist-antagonist superset would involve a barbell benchpress and a backrow, whereas the barbell benchpress and pushups would involve the similar-biomechanical movements.
              An advantage of the first method is that it includes recovery during the session.
            - "HOLLYWOOD Does Fitness", 10 minutes, 19.02.2020: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOGif6OfbHg
              Well, sort of. Celebrity workouts are just like other workouts, actually. Don't expect to end up looking just like the celebrity you are imitating.
              According to one &ldqou;celebrity trainer&rdquo; <q><abbr>HIIT</abbr/> is the most powerful way to build strength and tone your body (...) [and] it's also the most effective way to target belly fat.</q>
              The man does apparently not realise that different training protocols have different outcomes. HIIT cannot hit all of these goals, i.e. strength, &dlquo;toning&rdquo; and reducing body fat.
              HIIT is not a suitable protocol for increasing strength because it involves short rest periods, while strength training involves longer rest periods.
              HIIT is not the most suitable protocol for muscle definition either, again because it involves short rest periods and is designed to keep your heart rate at a high level.
              We should also adapt our training as we age: the older we get, the more we need to focus on recovery. Resistance training should be less frequent.
              And even younger people should think about longevity.

              Doucette criticises on Eddie Hall's claim that you need to cut and bulk because you can't put on muscle while dieting.
              Someone who is using supplements and steroids loses muscle when cutting because they are at or above their genetic maximum.

              (20 minutes, 24.03.2017).
              <br />Greg explains that there are several test methods, such as skinfold caliper tests, underwater weighing, a <abbr title="dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry">DXA</abbr> (or <abbr>DEXA</abbr>) scan,
              or some other type of test based on electrical conductivity of the body. <!--0:40-->However, each test is essentially a guess,
              and comparing the results of different types of tests would not lead to an accurate comparison.
              <!--0:57-->Even a skinfold caliper test is only as accurate as the person testing.
              In addition, <q cite="https://youtu.be/Lv5rcuCspk0?t=108">In general, almost everyone underestimates what percent they are. Why? Because a low number is cool.</q>
              <!--2:38-->Greg did a test based on electrical conductivity, which put him at 18% body fat, and one using the calipers, that put him at 9.8%.
              <br /><!--3:20--><strong>Women</strong> have at least 9% body fat, due to essential body fat that they need to stay alive.
              However, a bikini girl at that body fat percentage would look anorexic.
              <!--4:30-->The average bikini girl competitor at a national level would have between 13 and 18% body fat. At the provincial level, they would have 20% body fat or more.
              <!--6:55-->The average body fat percentage for women [in Canada] is 33%, which corresponds to obesity. (Greg Doucette says he has tested hundreds of people in Canada.)
              <!--7:35-->For health reasons, women should stay below 30% body fat. However, a woman with 15% body fat who is not working out probably has a nutrition problem or a physical disorder (unless the cause is genetic).
              <br /><!--9:31--><strong>Men</strong> need at least 3% body fat to stay alive. Tests that give a lower body fat percentage should be considered unreliable.
              <!--10:35-->Men participating at national-level &ldquo;physique&rdquo; competitions have between 6% and 9% body fat.
              A 6% body fat level is very hard to maintain outside competitions; it results in a very vascular and shredded look.
              <!--11:37-->Bodybuilders at nationnal-level competitions reach a body fat percentage of 4% to 6%.
              <!--13:06-->Men [in Canada] have 25% body fat on average, which also constitutes obesity. (Greg does not claim to use an exact definition of obesity in this video.)
              For health reasons, men should aim for 20% or less body fat. Leaner is better as long as you don't get too lean.
              <!--13:55-->For example, endurance athletes such as marathon runners and professional cyclists might get in the range of 5 to 7%.
              <!--14:17-->Most men who hire Greg Doucette (and are already training) have between 15% and 18% body fat.
              <br /><!--15:03-->At the end of the video, Greg gives examples of (hypothetical) people who underestimate their body fat percentage.

              (8 minutes, 08.09.2017).
              <br />According to Greg Doucette, fasted cardio is nonsense. It became populer in the 1990s, based on the belief that it burns fat.
              <!--1:11-->However, training on an empty stomach slows you down. Professional athletes don't skip breakfast.
              <!--2;00-->Fastened cardio does not burn more fat in the long run, which is what really matters.
              For example, <abbr>HIIT</abbr> burns more carbs than fat due to its high intensity. That does not imply that it is not good for burning fat:
              when the <abbr>HIIT</abbr> cardio session is over, the body burns more fat than carbs.
              <br /><!--2:53-->If you do slow, steady-state cardio on an empty stomach, <!--3:34-->the body may burn some of your muscle for energy.
              <!--4:15-->In order to burn fat instead of muscle, you need a calorie deficit in the long run. It does not matter when you burn the fat,
              <abbr>i.e.</abbr> during the cardio or after it. The longer the cardio session goes, the more fat will be burnt.
              <!--5:00-->For example, if you are on a 1200 calorie diet, you need to burn more than 1200 calories to lose fat.
              A 500 calorie deficit per day should result in one pound of fat loss per week.
              <br /><!--5:40-->If fasted cardio makes you feel good, you can keep doing it, but you shouldn't think it is better than normal cardio.

              (17 minutes, 06.03.2019).
              <br />Greg Doucette provides tips for maintaining a calorie deficit. The tips are not in any specific order.
              (1) Avoid crackers, doritos, chips, trail mix and similar calorie-rich snacks. You can replace them with &ldquo;smart pop pop-corn&rdquo;.
              <!--3:24-->(2) Avoid milk and cream; replace with Natrel lactose-free skimmed milk (it has 80 calories and 13 grams of protein per cup).
              (Natrel is a Canadian brand.)
              <!--4:55-->Dairy fat is not good for the human body.
              <!--5:05-->(3) Avoid ice cream; you can replace it with Greek ice cream yogurt bars. The contain around 90 to 100 calories.
              <!--6:36-->(4) Avoid candy (jelly beans etcetera); you can replace them with hard candy, which you cannto simply chew and swallow.
              <!--8:15-->(5) Avoid soft drinks or soda pop; replace them with diet versions. They don't cause cancer or make you eat more in the long run.
              <!--9:30-->(6) Avoid fruit juice; it contains too much sugar. It is better to eat the fruit it comes from instead of a less nutritious derivative that contains many empty calories.
              <!--11:34-->(7) Avoid cereals; <q cite="https://youtu.be/Yl7k42xqVvU?t=698">all cereals are bad</q>, even if the packaging claims the cereals are full of fiber or protein or both.
              They all make you eat more than you need.
              <!--12:59-->(8) Avoid nuts. A handful of nuts can contain 300 calories. For the healthy fats in nuts, you can drink almond milk instead.
              Nuts are for people who want to bulk up or who do a lot of cardio.
              <!--14:13-->(9) Replace condiments with light condiments. For example, replace ordinary ketchup with a sugar-free version.
              <!--15:20-->(10) Avoid muffins; you can replace them with cake. Even donuts contain fewer calories than muffins.

              (17 minutes, 11.05.2019).
              <ol>
                <li>Always warm up with light to moderate cardio. You should be slightly sweating at the start of the training session.</li>
                <li><!--1:04-->Train the hardest exercises first, instead of pre-fatiguing muscles. For example, if squats are the hardest exercise in the workout, do these first.</li>
                <li><!--1:58-->Instead of counting reps, time your sets, since &ldquo;time under tension&rdquo; is what counts.
                  For muscle hypertrophy, the time under tension should be around 40 seconds; a shorter time under tension benefits strength rather than hypertrophy.
                  But sets should not be shorter than 20 seconds.
                </li>
                <li><!--3:50-->The work-to-rest ratio should be between three-to-one and five-to-one.
                  For example, if a set takes one minute (which is long), the rest period should be between three and five minutes.
                  Shorter periods turn the workout into toning or cardio training and force you to use lower weights.
                </li>
                <li><!--7:13-->Make the eccentric phase longer than the concentric phase; ideally twice as long.
                  If you do 12 reps that last three seconds each, you get close to 40 seconds of time under tension.
                </li>
                <li><!--8:58-->Train hard sets close to failure. (If you can do five sets of 10 reps, the first four sets were too light.)</li>
                <li><!--10:06-->Use proper form. Otherwise you either don't hit the right muscles, or you get injured.</li>
                <li><!--11:22-->Active rest helps clearing lactic acid from the muscles.</li>
                <li><!--12:44-->Train each body part twice a week, especially weak body parts.
                  A small muscle such as the biceps can handle between 15 and 20 sets per week, which means 7 to 10 sets per session.
                  Bigger muscles such as the back and the legs can handle 20 to 30 sets per week.
                  The exact number depends on the person, training experiecen and other factors.
                </li>
                <li><!--14:25-->Always stretch after a workout in order to prevent tightness and injuries.
                  (Stretching before a workout makes you weaker.)

              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_73Sg6Xu8Tk">How To Properly Warm-Up For Your Hard Training Sessions - Weight - Sets - Reps</a>
              (17 minutes, 05.02.2020).
              <br />This is not about the cardio warmup, which is easy, but about warmups with weights.
              Warmup sets are meant to prepare you for the actual sets that count towards the workout.
              Most people need two or three warmup sets before the actual hard sets.
              In the first warmup should uses roughly half the weight of a hard sets and run to double the number of reps of a hard set.
              After the warmup set, you should rest until the muscle no longer feels fatigued.
              The second warmup set should use around 70 percent of the weight of a hard set and consist of fewer reps than the first warmup set.
              This set should still be easy; you should be able to do ten more reps if you wanted to.
              After the second warmup set, you will need to rest a bit longer, possibly a minute to a minute and a half.
              The last warmup set should have a rep range of 10 to 12.
              If you plan to train to failure with heavey weights and a low rep range, you will need more warmup sets.
              <br />If after the hard sets for the first exercise, you plan to do another exercise for the same muscle,
              you need only one or two warmup sets because the muscle is already warmed up.

              1:59: Alan Roberts says he takes in one gram per pound of lean body mass per day, which at the time of the creation of the video amounted to 175-180 grams per day.
              Above that amount of protein, it is more useful to add carbs instead of protein as a source of energy for your workouts.

              However, there is a small percentage of people who try to do everything the right way - eat as well as they can, get the right amount of sleep, work out with intensity and a good program -
              and who still have problems putting on muscle mass. Usually, this is because their metabolic level is so high that they burn through the calories they take in before they can start building muscle.
              They cannot ingest enough food to reach a caloric excess.
              Alan Roberts gvies the example of someone who thought he ate a lot and was at a level of 3000 calories per day.
              He had difficulty increasing this to 4300-4400 calories per day.

              Alan Roberts is not a Mark Rippetoe fan, for example because of his negative opinions about yoga.
              Rippetoe's book Starting Strength is a book for beginners; for example, it teaches people how to squat.
              Alan Roberts changed his squats from low-bar squats to high-bar squats in order to protect his back and increase his strength,
              and suggest that you don't learn to squat from a book. Watching videos by Alan Thrall, for example, or getting a really good trainer, should be more helpful.
              The Rippetoe-style squat does not seem to work for very heavy squats and it is difficult to reteach yourself the motor pathways required to squat in a different way.
              For this reason, it is important to learn to perform the squat the right way from the beginning, i.e. so you don't need to relearn the movement later on.

              This video is a response to a question sent to Alan Roberts through YouTube or Instagram about how to get back into lifting as middle-aged man.
              First, you shoud visit your doctor to make sure you are fit to get back into lifting.
              Second, you should set challenging but realistic goals (e.g. related to fat loss).
              Third, you should get some guidance on the basic movements, ideally from a personal trainer.
              Then you should find out how to fit the training and nutrition changes into your lifestyle.
              Last but not least, no need to be consistent with your training and your nutrition.

              Getting fat doesn't happen over night. It's much easier to lose fat than to become fat, because you only need to take in fewer calories than you burn.
              1:53: However, a lean bulk is hard because you need to stay at at around 200 calories above your caloric maintenance.
              You can add 200 calories to your nutritional program by adding, for example, another cup of rice every single day.
              2:16: As long as you are getting the right amount of protein, you should add carbohydrates, since these also help build muscle, and then evaluate your progress at the end of every week.
              You can take a picture of yourself in the mirror and compare it with the picture from the week before. You may find yourself losing some vascularity.
              However, if you notice yourself gaining fat, e.g. love handles, you will need to cut back a bit.
              2:41: You need to find your caloric maintenance level and just go 200 calories above it. You need to be consistent with this.
              2:47: If you try a so-called dirty bulk, you will gain body fat, because those excess calories will not all be turned into muscle.

              Alan Roberts criticizes an Instagram video in which V Shred explains how to perform the deadlift. Unfortuntely, Vince from V Shred's instructions are both incomplete and inaccurate.
              [3:40] He does not explain how wide apart the feet should be (the puts them too far apart for a conventional deadlift but too close together for a sumo deadlift),
              [3:55] which part of the feet should be under the bar (just the toes, the midfoot or the entire foot)
              [4:14] and his arms are farther apart than they should be (they should be shoulder-width apart for a conventional deadlift).
              [4:50] The deadlift is one of the more complicated exercises in fitness and that can easily lead to injuries, even with a relatively light weight.
              [5:35] Other issues with V Shred's video are that his arms aren't straight enough and his upper back is rounded.
              [6:15] Moreover, he does not explain how to stabilise your core.
              [9:55] Vince does not mention the importance of engaging the lats, keeping a neutral spine, bracing your core.

              Diet culture is pervasive in our culture; it is mostly aimed at women and often projects an ideal that is not even healthy.
              [2:04: "fuck TikTok"] For example, it is very unnatural for a woman to have visual abs throughout the year.
              Diet culture often offfers quick fixes that can't be maintained over time, both regarding nutrition and exercise.
              However, fat culture is equally dangerous. It demonises healthy eating and weight loss.
              Since obesity slowly kills people and it is much easier to get overweight than to get to thin, fat culture is much more dangerous.

              This video comments on a Tiktok video in which a morbidly obese woman eats unhealthy foods while displayint the message 'Body positivity should be for amputees and burn victims ... not fat pigs that can't stop eating',
              while lyrics in the background say, 'I don't care'. For Alan Roberts, this woman is saying she doesn't care that body positivity was stolen from amputees, burn victims and people born without certain limbs.
              In addition, eating highly processed food to lyrics that say, 'I don't care' while many people are starving in the USA is extremely callous.

              CS: In reality, the report is specifically about the vaccine based on ChAdOx1, i.e. not all vaccines: the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine but not the vaccines by Johnson & Johnson, Moderna or Pfizer–BioNTech.  Among the 182-183 million in the USA who have received the first vaccine (or the  157-158 million who have been fully vaccinated), not everybody has received the AstraZeneca vaccine. Nevertheless, the VITT problem may now become an argument against the continued use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

              Among other things, he says [5:50] that you can't be mentally healthy and morbidly obese at the same time, due to the side effects of obesity.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAf5vjtHpAw">Suggestions For Lifting Beginners</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 6 minutes, 09.05.2018).
          <br />Alan Roberts sells several training programmes on his site, for example
          <a href="https://everydamndayfitness.net/collections/e-d-d-f-signature-series-programs/products/e-d-d-f-lean-mass-hypertrophy-program"><abbr>E.D.D.F.</abbr> LEAN MASS HYPERTROPHY PROGRAM</a>

          In this no-nonsense video, he explains that he once considered creating a programme for beginners and why he decided not to do that after all.
          Beginners should learn the four basic lifts (the bench press, the squat, the deadlift and the overhead press), but these exercises shouldn't be taught using distance learning.
          The reason is that there are both mental and physical variables that need to be taken into account by a coach who is physically present can correct (and a video can't).
          Physiological variablese that need to be taken into account include height, weight, age, body fat percentage, the length of the femur, even the length of the femur's neck.
          <br />For this reason, Alan Roberts recommends that beginners should find a strength coach who can teach the four basic lifts in person.
          After about six months of getting proficient at these exercises, beginners can start worrying about curls or a novice programme,
          <abbr>i.e.</abbr> a three-times-per-week full-body programme that builds on the four basic lifts.
          Males who have between 12 and 20% body fat shouldn't worry too much about nutrition as long as they stay withing that range.
          If beginners start aiming for caloric deficits in order to make their abs visible, they will rob themselves of what Alan Roberts calls "noob gains" or lean mass gains.
          As long as you eat healthy (with sufficient protein, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass) and work out hard using the four basic lifts,
          you will develop a good-looking physique.
          Alan Robets doesn't believe in supplemenation for beginners; they should be getting enough protein through regular food.
          He stresses the fact that training needs to be consistent: <q>fitness is a lifestyle</q>.

          First, younger people at the gym don't care about what you used to do or be able to do.
          Second, use a towel in the locker room and in the sauna.
          Third, stop staring at girls who are half your age and who are working out in tight clothes.
          Fourth, ask a trainer or research what to do instead of making up your own exercises. If the gym offers a free walkthrough, use that walkthrough.
          Fifth, seek advice, not friendship.
          Finally, follow the rest of the gym etiquette rules, such as putting the weights back and moving away from a machine once you're done with an exercise.

          <br />You won't always be symmetrical; some level of asymmetry is normal. <!--3:54--> Some muscles grow faster than others.
          <!--5:11-->Some muscles don't grow at all; for many people it is the calf muscles. Don't try every muscle the same way if that doesn't work.
          <br /><!--6:42-->It is not true that you can only get big muscles if you bulk. Bulking works but it is not the only way.
          <!--7:45-->Increasing your calorie intake more slowly is better, because it allows you to see what your body is capable of.
          For example, you may find that increasing your calorie intake from 2500 to 3000 is sufficient for your goals.
          <br /><!--8:37-->You don't have to do compound movements. Squats, bench press, military press and deadlifts are great exercises
          and if you do them when you are starting you, you will probably see increases in size. You can also get big doing just isolation exercises or using only machines.
          <br /><!--10:12-->Cardio can help you put on muscle, even though it is not the most standard way. You need to be fit to lift weights, so cardio is a good idea.
          You just need to make sure that you take in enough calories to balance the calories that you burn through cardio.
          <br /><!--11:57-->Weightlifting won't wreck your joints in you train properly, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> by warming up properly, stretching afterwards, etcetera.
          <br /><!--13:03-->Some people will think you're stupid because you lift weights.
          <br /><!--13:34-->Stress can stop your gains. Sleep and recovery are important because they keep your stress levels low.
          <br /><!--14:29-->Weightlifting is not the answer to anything.

          <br />For beginners, inventing new exercises is not a good idea.
          Variation in exercises is valuable, but if you take it too far, it becomes difficult to track your progress because you don't do certain exercises frequently enough.
          Schofield also says that people who train naturally should not listen too much to people who are enhanced.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Shredded Sports Science</i> on YouTube, 9 minutes, 31.05.2021).
          <br />Some people claim that you shouldn't do <abbr>HIIT</abbr> if you are in a muscle-building cycle.
          In other words, if you have concurrent protocols, one may inhibit the other.
          James refers to the paper <a href="http://europepmc.org/article/MED/28647284">The effects of high intensity interval training on muscle size and quality in overweight and obese adults</a>
          by Malia N. M. Blue, Abbie E. Smith-Ryan, Eric T. Trexler and Katie H. Hirsch (<i class="journal">Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport</i>, June 2017),
          but this is about a very specific population.<!--@@download free PDF-->
          He therefore looks at two other papers:
          <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/9000/Effect_of_Concurrent_Power_Training_and.94825.aspx">Effects of Concurrent Power Training and High-Intensity Interval Cycling on Muscle Morphology and Performance</a>

          <!--https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Effects+of+Concurrent+Power+Training+and+High-Intensity+Interval+Cycling+on+Muscle+Morphology+and+Performance&ia=web -->
          <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sms.12751">Effects of high-intensity interval cycling performed after resistance training on muscle strength and hypertrophy</a>
          by Tsitkanou <abbr>et al</abbr> (<i class="journal">Scandinavian Journal of Medicine &amp; Science in Sports</i>, 2017).<!--@@download free PDF-->
          <!--https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=Effects+of+high-intensity+interval+cycling+performed+after+resistance+training+on+muscle+strength+and+hypertrophy&ia=web -->
          <br />The paper by Tsitkanou <abbr>et al</abbr> is about an eight-week study which found that the <abbr>HIIT</abbr> did not negatively impact on the muscle growth and strength growth potential.
          However, the group that did <abbr>HIIT</abbr> experienced a decrease in
          <a href="https://www.scienceforsport.com/rate-of-force-development-rfd-2/">rate of force development (<abbr>RFD</abbr>)</a>, which can be disadvantage to athletes.
          But the advantage of the <abbr>HIIT</abbr> was increase in capillary density, which can be beneficiary for the aerobic system.
          The study does not support the claim that <abbr>HIIT</abbr> inhibits muscle growth.
          <br />The paper by Spiliopoulou <abbr>et al</abbr> is about a six-week study in which a power training protocol was followed by <abbr>HIIT</abbr>
          (three times per week). The group who did <abbr>HIIT</abbr> suffered inhibition to their countermovement jump power performance;
          this is consistent with the decrease in <abbr>RFD</abbr> found in the study by Tsitkanou <abbr>et al</abbr>.
          <br />James says there is room for further research in this area. He also looks at the meta-analysis
          <a href="https://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Fulltext/2012/08000/Concurrent_Training__A_Meta_Analysis_Examining.35.aspx">Concurrent training: a meta-analysis examining interference of aerobic and resistance exercises</a>
          by Jacob M. Wilson <abbr>et al</abbr> (<i class="journal">Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</i>, 2012)<!--@@download free PDF-->,
          but this looked at endurance training, not <abbr>HIIT</abbr> per se. This meta-analysis found that
          <q> athletes whose sport requires maximal power or rate of force development should limit concurrently training for strength and endurance.
          However, if an athlete's sport is primarily dependent on maximal strength and hypertrophy, then concurrent training may not lead to significant decrements,
          given the proper modality of endurance training is selected.</q>

          (<i class="ytchannel">Jeremy Ethier</i> on YouTube, 13 minutes, 04.04.2021).
          <br />The amount of body fat you need to get rid off to make a six-pack visible varies based on several factors.
          The video presents a formula to calculate the &ldquo;time to six-pack&rdquo;: <code>bodyweight goal = lean body weight / (1 - desired body fat percentage)</code>.
          To determine your lean bodyweight, you need to estimate your bodyfat percentage (roughly visually) and divide this by your current bodyweight, then substract that number from your bodyweight.<!--lean body weight: 0.8*62=49.6-->
          Then pick your goal bodyfat percentage; you can be conservative here, since you can always push on later. (The video chooses 12% as an example.)
          Based on this, you get the bodyweight you would have with the desired bodyfat percentage.<!--49.6/0.88=56.4--> Based on this, you can determine how much fat you need to lose.
          <br /><!--3:35-->Don't make the mistake of trying to lose that weight as fast as possible. There is a limit to the amount of weight you can lose per day; beyond that limit, you will lose weight by losing muscle tissue.
          Jeremy refers to the study <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21558571/">Effect of two different weight-loss rates on body composition and strength and power-related performance in elite athletes</a>
          by Ina Garthe and others (2011). Based on this, Jeremy recommends losing 0.7% of your current bodyweight per week.
          <br />You need to be consistent and expect ups and downs. Many people use diet breaks to help reach their weight-loss goal.

          <i class="website">Livestrong.com</i>, 10.02.2011; updated on 19.05.2020.
          <br />Like the article from March 2011 (updated in March 2017), this article also concludes that doing the same exercise every day is not the best way to make progress.

        <li>Bedosky, Lauren:
          <a href="https://www.livestrong.com/article/406719-is-doing-pushups-every-day-bad/">How Bad Is It Really to Do Push-Ups Every Day?</a>,
          <i class="website">Livestrong.com</i>, 25.03.2011; updated on 10.03.2017.
          <br />Resistance training, such as doing pushups, causes microtears in muscle fibers. These microtears are repaired during rest days,
          resulting in larger and stronger muscles. Without rest days, you are likely to slow your progress.
          Moreover, doing pushups without correct form can result in pain or injuries in the shoulders or neck. It may also increase the risk of biceps tendonitis.
          Other potential risks include lower back pain and wrist pain.
          <br />Varying the type of pushups you do may get around some of these issues, but only if you use correct form.
          In addition, many pushup variations are more difficult than the traditional pushup.
          <br />For beginners, the article recommends starting with a regression and doing pushups on two non-consecutive days per week.
          <br />Finally, for more balance, it is better to also include upper-body pull exercises into one's workout routine.

          (<i class="ytchannel">The Bioneer</i> on YouTube, 18 minutes, 17.06.2021).
          <br /><!--2:00-->If you train your core stability and rotational strength, the doing high repetitions of body-weight exercises is one of the best things you can do for yourself.
          The bioneer explains how a perfect pushup is done: don't let the waist droop, don't flare your elbows, use a full range of motion, spee (this doesn't need to be always slow).
          <!--Studies on range of motion:
            4:11: Brad J. Schoenfeld & Jozo Grgic: Effects of range of motion on muscle development during resistance training interventions: a systematic review.

          -->
          <!--4:50-->There are several benefits of doing many repetitions. A constant tension in the muscles makes it harder for the blood to fully escape,
          which leads to the build-up of metabolytes, including growth hormones. It also leads to vascularisation. See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAID_principle"><abbr>SAID</abbr> principle</a>: specific adaptation to imposed demands.
          (<!--7:20-->Strength and endurance are probably more important than max strength for general performance in life and sports.)
          <!--8:50-->When you get fatigued, the body switches from using slow-twitch muscle fiber (which is more energy efficient) to fast-twitch muscle fiber.
          <br /><!--10:04-->If you want to learn to do pushups, some people start with an easier variation. The Bioneer suggest that you first do a &ldquo;mechanical dropset&rdquo;
          (as many reps as you can until failure) and that you switch to an easier variation only then.
          For example: start with normal pushups, then move to knee pushups and finally wall pushups.
          <br /><!--11:30-->The Bioneer also goes through a few more challenging variations, such as the one-handed pushup, the archer pushup, assisted one-arm pushups.
          He also talks about varying the cadence during a set, quasi-isometric pushups, plyometric pushups.

          <i class="website">Medical News Today</i>, 23.08.2019.
          <br />This article describes benefits of pushups, such as increased joint support, increased muscle tone and strength
          and improved cardiovascular health. It also warns against risks of doing daily pushups:
          reaching a fitness plateau, lower back pain, wrist pain and elbow injury.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Healthier Than Yesterday</i> on YouTube, 4 minutes, 11.12.2017).
          <br />YouTube and other social media have many videos about pushup challenges, for example, doing 100 pushups every day for 30 days.
          These challenges have no scientific background and can be harmful to the muscles and the joints.
          <br />First, the muscles need recovery to grow. Second, muscle growth requires variation.
          Finally, repeating the same exercises in the same way increases the risk of injury to the joints.
          <br />Note: this video has both background music and a robotic voice. The repair process that enables muscle growth requires approximately 48 hours.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AipjqgmId7k">Road to 100 Pushups: The Daily Program</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Kurt Frankenberg</i> on YouTube, 3 minutes, 02.11.2012).
          <br />This video proposes a training schedule based on the maximum numer of pushups you can perform at the beginning.
          In the first week, you start with a number that is 0.6 times your maximum; for example, if your max is 30, your initial training number is 18.
          Based on this, you do one set of this training number each day.
          After seven days, you add 1 to your training number; on the ninth day, you add another pushup, and so on.
          <br />If your training number wasn't 18 but 4 (because your max was 8), you will do 5 pushup on the eighth day, 6 on the ninth day, 7 on the tenth day,
          and so on.
          <br />Finding your max is described in the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycOHSqy4SKU">Road to 100 Pushups: First, Find Your Current Max</a>
          (29.10.2012). Note that the demonstration of the video does not explain correct form. In addition, in an attempt to be &ldquo;honest&rdquo;
          Kurt Frankenberg puts an object on the floor (as some sort of control) that actually prevents full range of motion.
          <br />Note that this video still recommends doing pushups very day, without a rest day, in spite of the drawbacks (slower progress and risk of injuries).
          Don't follow this advice.
          <br />The video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xGNjAsm9WQ">How To Do 100 Pushups [in a Row]</a> (21.03.2011).
          presents a program that was developed for mixed martial artists. The program was inspired by the story of the Greek wrestler
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_of_Croton">Milo of Croton</a>, who was said to be able to carry a bull on his shoulders.
          This video still insists on doing pushups every day. A &ldquo;rest day&rdquo; is just a day on which you do fewer pushups and
          you should not have two such &ldquo;rest days&rdquo; in a row.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0QLuQy2Pxc">From 0 to 100 PUSH UPS. Follow this routine..</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Karate <abbr>TV</abbr></i> on YouTube, 8 minutes, 25.04.2019).
          <br />This video begins by demosntrating correct form (although the elbows don't need to be as close to the body as shown in the video).
          It then shows a routine for beginners (who can't do 10 press-ups): 10 knee press-ups, one minute rest, 10 incline press-ups, one minute rest, and incline press-ups until failure, followed by staying in the inclide position for at last 10 seconds.
          This is the Monday workout; you rest on Tuesday.
          On Wednesday you do 10 inline press-ups with a backpack on your back for extra weight, rest one minute, do ten more, rest one minute, then do a set until failure.
          <br />For the intermediate level, you do the same number of sets and reps but on the ground instead of inclined and also with the backpack on your back.
          For the advanced level, you do the same but declined. Another push-up variation can be used for the second set: going down very slowly and coming up in a burst.
          <br />The Wednesday workout is followed by one day of rest. The Friday workout goes as follows:
          50 strict reps, but if or when you fail before 50 (say at 20), you go to the next easier level (incline press-ups) until failure and then transition to the next easier level (knee press-ups),
          and the finally wall press-ups.
          <br />For the intermediate and advanced levels, you need to add more weight.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjsJAtBeXr8">100 PUSH UPS every day for 30 days - unexpected results!</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Laura Try</i> on YouTube, 10 minutes, 17.06.2021).
          <br />Laura and her mate Ben tried to 100 press-up challenge during the Covid-19 lockdown. Before the challenge, she could do 12 press-up and Ben could do 44.
          They then did 100 press-ups per day, spreading them throughout the day without ever going to failure. Laura cites the
          <a href="https://www.freeletics.com/en/blog/posts/greasing-the-groove/">greasing the groove</a> principle from freeletics.com:
          <q>Greasing the groove is a training principle used to increase neurological pathways, gain strength and improve your ability to do an exercise. It involves practicing the exercise with many sets but with low reps, as to never bring the muscles to exhaustion.</q>
          Laura's form improved but she also accumulated both physical and mental fatique, skipping three full days and managing only 15 press-ups on the last three days.
          Two days after the thirty-day challenge (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> after two days of rest for a max-rep test), she found that she could do only 13 press-ups and Ben only 49, which is a much smaller increase than expected.
          <br />The second half of the video tries to figure out why this increase was so low. Personal trainer Sam Bacon says
          that either there wasn't enough of a stimulus to induce an adaptation or it was too much of a stimulus and not enough recovery.
          He recommends using the principle of progressive overload. However, there were benefits to the challenge, such as better in press-ups,
          more stable shoulders during the press-ups, improvement in certain yoga positions, an increase in muscle mass in each arm, and a stronger core.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Simple Strong Science</i> on YouTube, 4 minutes, 02.01.2019).
          <br />There are various potential causes of shoulder clicks. One is caviations, which you don't need to worry about.
          The clicking may also be caused by big muscles, particulary the pecs and the lats, pulling the head of the humerus forward and outward from its natural resting place.
          Even if this initially may not cause pain, it should not be ignored. <!--2:11--> Several shoulder activation exercises are recommended and demonstrated in the video.
          First: exercises with bands attached roughly at eye height: a high row with shoulder retraction, a reverse fly with shoulder retraction, and downward pulldowns.
          In each of these exercises, the shoulders need to be retracted before performing the actual movement.
          Next: exercises with the bands attached roughly at knee height: a 90-degree shoulder external rotation, a hybrid shoulder flexion/abduction exercises (facing away from the wall),
          a modified shoulder protraction (facing away from the wall) and the &ldquo;vicitory pose&rdquo; (facing the wall). This circuit should take less than five minute to complete.

          Since these muscles consist mainly of type-1 muscle fibres, so strengthening them requires high rep ranges and low loads.
          <br />The second part of the video describes a few exercises to prevent rotator cuff injuries.
          The first exercise is chest foamrolling to relax overworked rotator cuff muscles.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6dLX0Q5xzY">How Much Protein To Build Muscle? The TRUTH !</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Shredded Sports Science</i> on YouTube, 12 minutes, 16.06.2018).
          <br />According to a review and meta-analysis by Morton <abbr>et al.</abbr>,
          <q>protein intakes at amounts greater than ~1.6 g/kg/day do not further contribute <abbr title="resistance exercise training">RET</abbr>-induced gains in <abbr title="fat-free mass">FFM</abbr></q>.
          People on social media recommend a very wide range of numbers regarding protein intake. For example, Jim Stoppani recommends 1.5&ndash;2 grams per pound of bodyweight.
          Imar Isuf recommends 1 gram per pound of bodyweight and says you don't need to obsess about the perfect amount of good protein in every meal as long as you get enough protein in total.
          Mike Dolce does not give specific numbers but focuses on good-quality nutrients. Eric Helms recommends 0.8&ndash;1.3 grams of protein per pound of bodyweight.
          Helms also says the amount of protein you need is not as high as people are led to believe.
          <br />James says, <q cite="https://youtu.be/b6dLX0Q5xzY?t=262">How much protein you take depends very heavily on your specific characteristics</q>.
          These characteristics include the following: (1) your training level and intensity (reps, frequency, etcetera, how much muscle you break down);
          (2) your body composition; (3) your goals (maintaining muscle mass or increasing it); (4) your current state (or you an athlete or do you exercise of leisure);
          (5) are you natural or chemically enhanced; (6) your eating protocol.
          <br /><!--0:04-->Another factor is the thermic effect of food: the digestion of macronutrients also burns calories,
          and proteins have a higher thermic effect than carbohydrates and fats: as high as 30 % of the calories from protein are burnt up during this process.
          <br />Protein intake recommendations on social media are often inflated. The leaner you get, however, <q>the more you might want to increase the protein intake
          as you drop and manipulate other macronutrients</q>. It is better to look at your fitness over a long period of time instead of panicking about your protein intake in a single meal.

          <br />This video is for the regular fitness enthusiast who wants to gain muscle.
          James presents a pyramid to help people take decision about their protein intake.
          Quality protein means that all nine essential amino acids not to be represented: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine and lysine.
          Not all of these need to come from one piece of food; they can also come from a combination of foods such as rice and beans.
          <br />The first layer of the pyramid is the amount of protein you need.
          There is no consensus on the exact amount of protein intake for muscle growth; instead, we have a range of figures.
          These recommendations may be expressed in various ways, for example, grams per kilogram of total body weight, grams per kilogram of lean mass or grams per pound of bodyweight.
          Schoenfeld and Aragon found that 1.6&ndash;2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of total body weight is the range of protein needed for growth.
          Beyond 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of total body weight there seems to be a point of diminishing returns.
          <br /><!--6:54-->The second layer of the pyramid is the frequency of protein intake. According to Schoenfeld and Aragon, it makes sense to take in
          0.4 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight per meal across four meals. This can help a state of net anabolism over the day.
          <br /><!--8:24-->The third and least important layer of the pyramid is the timing of protein intake. There is no post-workout anabolic window.
          The timing of protein intake is much less important than getting the quantity right. However, if you are fasted before your workout,
          the need for protein intake after your workout increases. If you have had a pre-workout meal, the need for protein intake after your workout decreases.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Dr. Sten Ekberg</i> on YouTube, 29 minutes, 09.07.2021).
          <br />According to Ekberg, nobody can tell you exactly how much protein you need.
          It is insufficient to look at the amount of protein on a label: you need to know whether you can digest and absorb it.
          The quality of the protein is also important because it determines how much of it is converted into muscle and how much is converted into glucose.
          <br /><!--3:35-->Protein and fats are essential, unlike carbohydrates. Proteins provide building blocks for many structures in the body, not just muscles.
          Hemoglobin (which carries oxygen), albumin, globulins (a sort of carriers for minerals etcetera), hormones and enzymes are also proteins: this is what makes proteins essential.
          The body turns excess protein into glucose (but this does not make proteins essential).
          <br /><!--7:03: @@utilisation-->There are eight or nine essential amino acids; you can remember them using the mnemonic &ldquo;prolamine&rdquo;.
          These essential amino acids are needed in a specific ratio. In an animal protein, this ratio will be closer to what we need than in a plant protein.
          In an animal protein, we have a utlisation ratio of around 30%; the remaining 70% gets converted into glucose.
          <br /><!--23:47-->The standard recommendation is for 10&ndash;35% of your calories to come from protein. Ekberg recommends 10&ndash;25%.
          If you were to eat only meat (like a carnivore), and the meat you eat contains 15% fat, you will get 36% of your calories from protein and around 64% from fat.
          However, most carnivores find meat tastier when it contains a bit more fat, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> around 20%.
          In that scenario, you would get around 26% of your calories from protein and 74% from fat.
          When increasing the fat percentage in the meat you eat to 25%, you get around 23% of your calories from protein and around 77% from fat.
          <!--16:17-->None of these numbers will give you protein toxicity. However, if you ate extremely lean protein, say meat containing 98% protein and 2% fat,
          you'd get 81% of your calories from protein and only around 19% from fat. This would result in
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_poisoning">&ldquo;rabbit starvation&rdquo;</a>.
          <!--18:24, 18:30-->Turning a lot of protein into glucose is very unnatural process for the human body; it is also rather inefficient, so you need to eat more.
          There is also a limit to the amount of protein the liver can convert into glucose; when the body reaches that limit, the remaining protein cannot be converted.
          This results in hunger with a full belly, diarrhoea (within a few days) and an excess of ammonia (from the nitrogen in the proteins) affecting the nervous system.
          Chicken breast has around 3.3% fat, so eating only chicken breast (without other fat) would also lead to protein poisoning.
          <br />Ekberg goes over ten types of food that are often promoted as protein sources (ranked from worst to best) and explains the different factors that determine whether they are a good source of protein or not.
          <ol>
            <li value="10"><!--1:25-->Soy is available in various forms. Soy milk is not a great source of protein because it is often loaded with sugar and it is often a genetically modified food (<abbr>GMO</abbr>).
              It is also hard to digest and is often an allergen.
              <!--2:14-->Another issue with soy is that is contains phytoestrogens: plant compounds that can mimic estrogen. Phytoestrogens fit into receptor sites in human cells and
              either block the body's estrogens from fitting in (inhibition) or they can fit in and stimulate the cells (overstimulation).
              <!--2:49-->If you eat soy, it's better to eat it in a form such as tofu, tempe or miso, because these are fermented, so there are bacteria that help with digestion.
              All cultures that have traditionally used soy always eat fermented soy.
            </li>
            <li value="9">Beans and other legumes (including peanuts) are hard to digest (causing gas) and are sometimes allergens. They are also rich in carbohydrates.
              Only around 17% of proteins from legumes gets utlised by the body (converted into tissues); the remaining 83% are turned into glucose for energy.
            </li>
            <li value="8"><!--9:17-->Egg white often tops the list of protein sources but it is incomplete without the yolk.
              Without the yolk, egg white is the worst animal source of protein: protein utilisation is around 17% (comparable to plant proteins); the remaining 83% is converted into glucose.
            </li>
            <li value="7"><!--10:57-->Nuts and seeds provide a plant protein; the utilisation ratio is around 17%. The upside of nuts and seeds is that they also provide good amounts of fiber and fat.
              The conversion into glucose is also relatively slow, so the glucose response will be lower. You get more fiber and protein from seeds such as flax, chia and pumpkin,
              whereas you get more fat and less fiber from nuts such as macadamia, pecan and walnut. Variety is good, so eat a little bit of everything, but you shouldn't turn these into staples.
            </li>
            <li value="6"><!--12:08-->Pork, turkey and chicken provide animal proteins with a utilisation ratio of 30%; the remaining 70% is converted into glucose.
              The problem with these sources is that it is difficult to find good-quality meat (<abbr>i.e.</abbr> from animals that have been pastured).
              They are also high in fat, and this is where most pesticides and other toxins are stored (because these are fat soluble).
              If you can find an animal that is &ldquo;clean&rdquo;, the fat is safe to eat; otherwise, you should choose lean meat.
            </li>
            <li value="5"><!--2:27-->Dairy is an animal protein with a protein utilisation of around 30%. However, why protein, the protein utilisation drops to 17%, with the remaining 83% being converted into glucose.
              Dairy should come from grass-fed cattle, ensure that the fats in it are healthy. In grain-fed cattle, the balance is different. Ideally, it should also be organic.
              Fermented dairy (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> yogurt and sour cream) is much easier for us to tolerate.
            </li>
            <li value="4"><!--24:08-->Cheese is a different, more concentrated form of dairy with a protein utilisation level of 30%. It should come from grass-fed cattle; ideally it should also be organic. It causes few allergies than other forms of dairy.
            </li>
            <li value="3"><!--24:56--->Red meat (lamb and beef) has a protein utilisation level of 30%. It is relatively easy to find good-quality red meat, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> from grass-fed animals.
            </li>
            <li value="2"><!--25:23-->Fish also has a protein utilisation level of 30%.
              It is relatively easy to find good-quality protein from fish, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> wild fish. It contains fish oil (which gives you <abbr title="eicosapentaenoic acid">EPA</abbr>).
              Ekberg's favourites include salmon, mackerel and sardines because the provide the highest rates of <abbr>EPA</abbr> and are pretty readily available.
              Fish is also a bit easier to digest than meat for most people. Ekberg recommends that you eat both fish and meat for variety. Cod, flounder and sole provide less <abbr>EPA</abbr>.
            </li>
            <li value="1"><!--27:00-->Whole eggs are Ekberg's number one source of protein. The egg yolk contains a higher percentage of protein than egg white
              but we have been taught to throw it away because of cholesterol. Cholesterol is a bad reason for throwing away the egg yolk.
              <q cite="https://youtu.be/YHNHpPGlvSY?t=1668"><!--27:48-->The egg is the most complete food source we have. The combination, the ratio of amino acids allow us to utilise it at 48%.</q>
              It is important that the chicken was pastured for healthy fats. The only food that's slightly better is breast milk.

          The differences depend on several factors, including age and level of activity.
          After the age of 30, the body needs 15% extra per additional year. People who train more endurance also need more than others.
          <br />The quality of protein is also important: when the quality is lower, the total intake needs to be higher.
          The intake of protein also needs to increase when you are in a caloric deficit in order to reduce body fat.

          Many other types of products are sold as protein sources, even though other macronutrients are domininant in them.
          Protein cereals such as Weetabix Protein (19% protein, compared to 12% protein for normal Weetabix, whereas the main macronutrient is carbohydrates),
          peanut butter (which contains fats but also many calories and just around 28% protein), bad protein bars (often self-described as healthy but in which fat dominates the protein content),
          edamame beans (which do provide proteins but also contain soy), &ldquo;protein balls&rdquo; or &ldquo;protein energy balls&rdquo; (which contain more carbohydrates than protein),
          protein flapjacks (which also contain more fat and much more carbohydrates than protein), protein cookies (which contain much more carbohydrates than protein),
          protein yoghurt (which is not bad in protein content but not much better than normal yoghurt), protein nuts (whic contain roughly the same amount as carbohydrates as protein),

          <br />Egg white contains just over half of the protein in an egg, but the yolk contains more proteins per gram (almost 16 grams of protein per 100 grams of yolk, compared to 11 gram of protein per 100 grams of egg white).
          The yolk contains all the fat in an egg. However, these fats are mostly monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are considered &ldquo;good&rdquo; fats.
          (Cholesterol levels are more strongly influenced by saturated fat and trans fat from other sources.)
          Egg yolks are also richer in B vitamins, folate, and vitamins A, D and E. The article therefore concludes that it is better to keep them in your nutrition.

          <br />Research on branched-chain amino acids (<abbr>BCAA</abbr>s) is often misrepresented on social media.
          There are nine esssential amino acids: histidine, lysine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, methionine, tryptophan and phenylalanine.
          Three of these are branched-chain amino acids: leucine, isoleucine and valine.
          (There are many more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteinogenic_amino_acid">proteinogenic amino acid</a>
          and not all proteins in the body are muscle tissue.)
          You need the full range of essential amino acids for effective protein synthesis and it is best to take a food-first approach for this instead of relying on supplements.
          <abbr>BCAA</abbr> supplementation in isolation probably leads to suboptimal results compared to consuming protein sources that contain all nine essential amino acids.
          You probably get all the <abbr>BCAA</abbr>s through your food; <!--6:44-->see

          Vegans may benefit from <abbr>BCAA</abbr> supplementation because they don't get enough of them through food alone.
          <!--7:38-->However, there is also research that suggests that taking in <abbr>BCAA</abbr> in a fasted state may decrease muscle mass (Robert Wolfe, 2017).

          <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine">Creatine</a> allows the body to create energy by converting
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_diphosphate">adenosine diphosphate (<abbr>ADP</abbr>)</a> into
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate">adenosine triphosphate (<abbr>ATP</abbr>)</a>.
          This may allow you to work harder in the gym and therefore get more results.
          <br />However, there is no direct causal relationship between creatine intake and muscle growth.
          Muscle growth requires progressive overload, consistency over time, an adequate protein intake and a caloric surplus.
          Supplements are not hacks that make these requirements optional.
          <br />The body uses <abbr>ATP</abbr> for energy, turning it into <abbr>ADP</abbr> in the process.
          The creatine phosphate will gave a phosophate to the <abbr>ADP</abbr> to turn it into <abbr>ATP</abbr> again.
          Creatine is naturally available in the body and can be ingested trough food (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> meat),
          but it is difficult for an adult to take in enough creatine through food to get an effective dose (around 3&ndash;5 grams per day).
          (It would require a kilogram of beef, for example.) That does not imply that you need to take a creatine supplement.
          <!--6:43: "Effect of creatine supplementation on body composition and performance: a meta-analysis", by J. D. Branch, Int. J. Sport Nutr. Exerc. Metab., 2003-->
          <br />Creatine monohydrate is the most common form and is economical. There is no need to complicate creatine intake.
          <!--7:20-->You can even use a loading phase in which you take 20 grams of creatine for a week, which allows faster saturation of creatine in your body.
          Otherwise, you cant take 3&ndash;5 grams per day.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Shredded Sports Science</i> on YouTube, 12 minutes, 07.04.2019).

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branched-chain_amino_acid">branched-chain amino acids (<abbr>BCAA</abbr>s)</a>,

          (It is a cheap ingredient that is essentially just a cheap filler in supplements.)
          <br />Branched-chain amino acids are useless.
          There has been research into <abbr>BCAA</abbr>s in rodents, which does not translate very well to humans.
          <br />Fat-loss supplements are also mostly useless, especially in the long run. A caloric deficit is more effective.
          People who recommend L- Carnitine for fat loss have not properly read the relevant research (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> about its effectiveness in overweight cats).
          <abbr>CLA</abbr> has been studied in rodents; there is no evidence that it has a significant effect on fat loss in humans.

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44WTG33KtpU">How To Pick The Best Protein Powder (CHOOSE WISELY!)</a>
          (<i class="ytchannel">Jeremy Ethier</i> on YouTube, 12 minutes, 20.12.2020).
          <br />The are various type of protein powders: based on whey, casein, soy, rice, pea, beef or egg.
          Whey protein is best because it contains significantly more leucine than the alternatives (including casein)
          and is more effectively absorbed by the body. Casein protein comes in close second on both criteria.
          Due to its slower absorption, casein protein is sometimes recommended before going to bed,
          but research has shown that this does not make it more effective than other good protein sources..
          <br />There are three types of whey protein: whey concentrate, whey isolate and why hydrolysate.
          Whey concentrate can vary between 35 and 80% protein and typically contains the highest percentage of carbs and fats.
          Whey isolate, which costs a bit more, is required to be at least 90% protein.
          Whey hydrolysate has gone through extra processing but has not been shown to be more effective than the two other types.
          Whey therefore appears to be the best option.
          <br />Plant-based protein powders can be deficient in certain essential amino acids and are less effective at increasing protein synthesis.
          However, you can combine several plant-based protein sources to increase protein synthesis.
          For example, one may combine pea protein, which is lower in methionine but higher in lysine, with rice protein, which is higher in methionine but lower in lysine.
          Soy protein is also a good source since it contains all the essential amino acids.
          <br />One should also learn to distinguish the good brands from the not-so-good ones. Jeremy Ethier interviews
          <a href="https://examine.com/about/#editors">Bill Willis of Examine.com</a> about protein supplements.
          Willis points out that in &ldquo;proprietary blends&rdquo; manufacturers don't disclose everything that's in it.
          You need to look how much protein is present in a single serving: look for the highest amount of protein per serving.
          Protein spiking means adding non-protein sources of nitrogen, such as glutamine and creatine, and declaring them as protein
          (the <abbr>FDA</abbr> test nitrogen levels in a product rather than protein levels).
          A term such as &ldquo;amino acid matrix&rdquo; is also an indicator of low-quality protein.
          <br />Some protein powders are also contaminated with heavy metals such as lead and cadmium, and plastic derivatives.
          These levels are not always dangerous but it is a good idea to find out what the manufacturer's testing protocols are.

          <br />James discusses a video in which Thomas De Lauer said that a study had found that three days into a fast,
          there was a 300% increase in human growth hormone levels and after one week of fasting an increase by 1250%.
          However, what is essential is how long this increase lasts. <!--2:42-->James also shows a video in which
          Dr. Layne Norton<!--YT channel BioLayne--> points out that fasting is not anabolic: muscle protein synthesis declines
          when you go from a fed state over digestion into a fasted state.
          <br />Anabolism and catabolism go up and down throughout the day, and the body has both anabolic and catabolic states during a single day.
          If you want to build muscle, you need to reach a <strong>net anabolic state</strong>.
          <q cite="https://youtu.be/vfFo5yX9OfA?t=275">A prolonged fasted state, by definition, is a catabolic state, where catabolic processes than anabolic processes.</q>
          Being fasted in isolation (!) is not anabolic. That does not mean that intermittent fasting prevents muscle growth;
          it means that when you eat, you have to make sure that you are creating a net anabolic state. It is not the fasting per se that causes muscle growth.
          <br /><!--6:00-->James contrasts another of De Lauer's statements on human growth hormone with one in which Layne Norton says
          while human growth hormone levels increase during a fast, the growth hormone itself is not anabolic, particularly for skeletal muscle.
          Increasing human growth hormone can increase lean body mass, <!--6:40-->but that is not the same thing as muscle mass.
          What you get are increases in connective tissue and body water.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Hospital for Special Surgery</i> on YouTube, 20 minutes, 27.05.2020).
          <br />Machowsky begins by presenting the &ldquo;fueling performance pyramid&rdquo;, which consists of three layers (from the bottom up):
          fundamental nutrition, performance nutrition and supplemental nutrition.
          <br />Fundamental nutrition includes aspects such as taking in enough calories, carbohydrates, protein (15&ndash;30 grams per meal),
          vitamins, minerals and hydration. Machowsky gives an example of a meal plan for someone who trains two hours per day and needs 3300 calories per day.
          <br />Performance nutrition is about what you take before, during or after training.
          Before practice you need carbohydrates, moderate protein, less fat and fiber, a source of sodium and some fluids.
          During practice you need electrolyes and fluids; for longer practice you may also need carbohydrates.
          After practice you need carbohydrates and protein in a way that are easily tolerated (for example from liquids), and a source of sodium.
          Anything that can be taken before practice would also be good after practice, but with more protein.
          <br />Recovery is not only about nutrition but also sleep. Young people need at least eight hours of sleep (or nine, depending on age and training intensity).
          <br />Supplemental nutrition has not always been studied in depth, especially for people under eighteen.
          In addition, not all manufacturers produce safe products. There are labs where you can get supplements tested.
          See also the <a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/">Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health</a>,

          <br />Machowsky recommends tracking your progress, including the tracking of training hours, hours of sleep, morning <abbr>RHR</abbr>, soreness and fatigue.
          <br />Machowsky also debunks a number of myths, for example, that nutrition does not matter when you're young,
          that certain foods are evil (carbs or animal protein), that certain supplements are critical (only a dozen, at best, have been proven to work),
          that you need more protein to bulk up (you actually need to take more carbs to build mass)
          or that you need to look like a specific person to be good athlete.

          <br />A fitness TikToker dry-scooped 4 doses of pre-workout followed by 4 doses dissolved into water.
          This represented 1600 mg of caffeine or four times the highest recommended daily limit.
          His blood pressure increased to a level that could not be measured by a blood-pressure machine in hospital and that caused bleeding in the brain.
          <br />Quote from the description below the video:
          <q>This particular kind of pre workout supplement should not be dry scooped. It is a dry powder that is formulated to be mixed with water. Powder dry like this is not designed to absorb through buccal mucosa.
          If it was designed to be, then it would in fact, let the pre hit harder since it wouldn't go to the liver first to be broken down, that is, bypass first-pass metabolism.
          If that happened, the amounts of some key ingredients would likely be lower. Instead, by doing this, you're creating a choking hazard for yourself because of a troll and haha funny laughs at the expense of your own health.
          You likely can damage your lungs if you cough and breathe in enough powder because you tried this.</q>

          <br /><!--1:25-->Most preworkout products recommend starting with a quarter scoop or a half scoop to assess your tolerance
          before working up to a full scoop. The woman in the video, a certain Briatney, appears to have ignored this ignored this
          and the effects the felt after taking the product: first, she felt tingly and itchy all over her body, then chest pain, later also nausea,
          then heavy sweating, returning chest pain and her left arm going limp. At the hospital, it turned out she had suffered a
          non-<abbr>ST</abbr> elevation myocardial infarction (<abbr>NSTEMI</abbr>). Doctors advised her to stay away from caffeine.
          (According to one of the comments on TikTok, the product she used (Total War) contains 300 mg of caffeine per scoop.)

          <br />The results of a single piece of research are not the ultimate truth; instead it is an addition to a growing body of knowledge.
          Some research lacks detail in order to properly understand it, for example when diet is described as a &ldquo;standard diet&rdquo;
          or when training regimens are described very vaguely (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> when the training schedule is mentioned but not other aspects

              Untrained people, V Shred's main audience, will see gains from V Shred's plans, but that also applies to many other plans.
              As <a href="https://www.poliquinstore.com/poliquin-principles-3rd-edition.html">The Poliquin Principles</a> pointed out,
              a beginner can do almost anything and experience gains. Unfortunately, the most visible information on the web is not
              necessarily the best. Beginners often get on a vicious cycle of seeing short-term results but do not get explained
              how to achieve &ldquo;results&rdquo; (however that term is defined) in the long term. So they become victims
              to all sorts of low-quality plans. People who understand fitness get frustrated by channels such as V Shred.
              There are much better channels, such as those by Alan Thrall and AlphaDestiny, which, for example,
              understand the deadlift much better.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Geoffrey Verity Schofield</i> on YouTube, 16 minutes, 23.02.2021).
          <br />On the lowest tier you find drama, vlogs, challenges, eating and (extreme) workout videos. Unfortunately, content in this tier is the most common type.
          On the second tier, labelled &ldquo;noob&rdquo;, you find full workouts, &ldquo;natty or not videos&rdquo;,
          follow-along workout videos and &dlquo;big lifts&rdquo;.
          <br />On the third tier, labelled &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;, you find technique videos (which you can't find on most channels because it is a less popular topic),
          splits, peer reviews and recipes.
          <br />On the fourth tier, labelled &ldquo;superb&rdquo;, videos are on a more conceptual level: concepts, fundamentals, analysis, teaching.
          <br />The fifth tier, labelled &ldquo;god tier&rdquo;, is both high-quality and entertaining.
          <br />Content on the higher tiers requires more attention and thought; it is also more useful.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 8 minutes, 11.11.2016).
          <br />This is about a YouTube channel that recommends exercies for men over forty.
          Many of the videos recommend exercises for the core, including even the human flag, which is a very advanced exercise.
          For the core, Alan Roberts recommends yoga, squats, deadlifts, front squats, bench press and the main core exercises.
          The obsession with crunches is misguided, since that exercise is not even good for your spine.
          <!--3:00-->Alan Roberts says that being on a caloric deficit of 200&ndash;300 calories per day for a while combined
          the exercises he recommends will bring out your abs. Roberts criticises that Six Pack Shortcuts does not discuss
          nutrition, since the nutritional requirements of men over 40 are a bit different from younger people:
          getting the right amount of protein, carbohydrates and fats (especially the right fats to make sure the hormonal levels stay correct) is essential.
          <!--6:13-->There are 3500 calories in a pound of fat, so if you want to lose a pound of fat, so you would need to burn 500 calories per day
          if you wanted to lose a pound of fat in seven days. Since you cannot spot-loose fat, you need to lose fat over the entire body
          in order to achieve visible abs. This requires a caloric deficit; doing only core exercises without adpapting your diet does not work.

          <br />This video was triggered by Kinobody's pre-workout product advertisement.
          Pre-workout products are not necessary, just a matter of preference. The decision should not be based on the product's taste
          or on anecdotal evidence, but on the ingredients. The primary ingredients are clearly show on the packaging, but
          some ingredients in Kinobody's pre-workout are redundant. Caffeine is an
          <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/ergogenic-aid">ergogenic aid</a> and is a valid ingredient
          and 150 mg (per serving of 10.5 grams) is not a megadose. If you do not respond well to caffeine, this product may not be for you.
          However, it is not significant aid to fat loss in the long term. The claims about how
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">l-theanene</a> works with caffeine are also correct.

          SixPackShortcuts is currently a better channel than before but is still losing subscribers and its videos get few views.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Chris Williamson</i> on YouTube, 11 minutes, 04.09.2019).
          <br />Dr Stuart McGill loves CrossFit for the cummunity. CrossFit tries to create athletes who have high endurance, high strength and high mobility,
          and these are three biological adaptations that are difficult to combine. For example, burpees can make the spine more mobile, but the body does not pay the price because there is no load.
          However, the next exercise may be repeated Olympic lifts, which are executed with a much higher load and allows no margin of error, and this causes problems.
          When you repeat Olympic lifts, the form will suffer. (Olympic lifters rarely need to see a doctor for back problems, they are more likely to have knee or shoulder problems.) (&hellip;)
          <br /><!--7:55-->One of the things Stuart McGill explains has to do with bone strength. Heavy exercises such as heavy squats or deadlits cause damage to the bones at the level of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteon">osteons</a>.
          A crossfitter may go running on his &rdquo;rest day&ldquo;, thereby not allowing the body to repair this microdamage. A powerlifter, by contrast,
          takes five days off. <!--8:57-->Stuart McGill explains that bone is a type of electric material: when you stress a bone, it builds an electric charge. This electric charge attracts free ions, such as calcium and magnesium,
          which get chemically bonded to the location of the fractures. It takes five days for these ions to scaffold on. Hence, if you train the same body part again,
          you break down the adaptation that you were trying to create. For this reason, the microdamage to the bone is a good thing for a powerlifter but not so good for a crossfitter.
          <br />Dr Stuart McGill also refers to his article

          <br />There is a place for CrossFit but it is a horrific fitness model. It inspires many people to start exercising, but they are often taught bad form and shortcuts (such poor squatting and deadlifts, kipping pullups and kipping dips).
          Personal trainers would teach proper form and help you reach a fitness-related goal instead of helping you to get good at working out.
          Instead of doing CrossFit, Alan Robets advises,

        - Fenugreek blocks testosterone from turning into estrogen. Take 300 mg of fenugreek per day.
        - Ginseng: Back in 1996, scientists discovered that this powerful root not only raised testosterone levels, but also heightened the production of LH. For serious T-boosting effects, consume between 100-200 mg of ginseng daily.
        - Zinc: supplementing with 40 mg of zinc per day elevates testosterone levels. [Overdose?]
        - "DHEA is a steroid hormone we naturally produce it can convert into testosterone and estrogen."

          (<i class="ytchannel">Science Insider</i> on YouTube, 13 minutes, 06.06.2021).
          <br />Physical therapists Dr. Wesley Wang and Dr. Stacie Morris debunk the follwoing myths:
          <ol>
            <li><q>Your knees should never pass your toes when squatting.</q>
              In fact, not allowing your knees pass your toes instead of moving naturally, causes problems elsewhere, for example in the ankles.</li>
            <li><q>Soreness is a sign of a good workout.</q> Workouts can cause soreness but the absence of soreness does not mean a workout was bad.</li>
            <li><q>Bigger muscles are stronger.</q> Bigger muscles <em>can</em> be stronger but the relationship is not always straightforward.</li>
            <li><q>You need to eat meat to build muscle.</q> You need protein, but you don't need to get that from meat.</li>
            <li><q>Cardio before weights.</q> It depends on your goals: if your goals are cardiovascular, you should do cardio first, if they are strength-related, you should do strength training first.
             In addition, weightlifting can be done as a form of cardio.</li>
            <li><q>Working out tones your muscles.</q> What does &ldquo;toning&rdquo; even mean?</li>
            <li><q>Exercise cancels out unhealthy eating habits.</q> It's not simply a matter of &ldquo;calories in, calories out&rdquo;; the quality of your nutrients is important.</li>
            <li><q>You should bulk and cut to build muscle.</q> If your goal is not to be a bodybuilder, this is unnecessary. If you want to bulk and cut simultaneously, you need to
              create a positive nitrogen state, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> the body's intake of nitrogen should be greater than the loss of nitrogen. This requires
              a higher intake of protein, taking creatine and getting enough sleep.</li>
            <li><q>You need to work out for at least an hour for it to have an effect.</q> According to the American College of Sports Medicine (<abbr>ACSM</abbr>),
              you should accumulate 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise over the course of the week for it to be considered effective for your cardiovascular health.</li>
            <li><q>Running will destroy your knees.</q> This is not backed by any research. However, you should not try to progress too quickly as a beginner. (&hellip;)</li>
            <li><q>The best way to burn fat is on an empty stomach.</q> Studies have shown that you don't need to do fasted cardio to burn fat.</li>
            <li><q>Lifting heavy weights at a young age will stunt your growth.</q> There is no evidence to support this claim. Moreover, weightlifting does not necessarily mean lifting extremely heavy weights.</li>
            <li><q>Assisted exercises are not as effective.</q> The claim is ambiguous. Assistance from bands, for example when doing pullups, can help you progress towards doing the exercise without assistance.</li>
            <li><q>You can't exercise with flat feet.</q> Flat feet are very common and you can't change the structure of your foot, but you can definitely exercise with flat feet.</li>

          (<i class="ytchannel">London Real</i> on YouTube, 46 minutes, 01.03.2020).
          <!--4:45: JC was still using the same camera from 2009 until three weeks before the interview.
            7:30: Talks about people copying other people's videos because they are science-based without understanding the content, e.g. confusing adduction with abduction.
            8:30: Training philosophy: you need to train all aspects of motion, not only strength; there is both a functional component and a corrective component.
            9:27: Some strange things about "functional training" around, but the pendulum has swung back to core things [?]
            9:45: Chasing numbers causes people to cheat etc. But people are not prepared for a slow journey nowadays. 
            10:40: We've lost appreciation for the process.
           11:15: Some professional athletes perform deadlifts with the weight on a mat a few inchess above the ground, because due to their long legs or other aspects ... 
           12:50: We are in an era of chasing numbers. Some people chase strength numbers. However, progressive overload is not the only way.
             13:20: For example, using lighter weights and slower reps; puts lower demands on the joints.
           13:50: Muscles are basically speaking the language of tension, they can't read the number on the side of the plate.
           14:43: You need to get over the human desire to speak the language of numbers because the body doesn't speak that way.
           When you go into the gym on a day when you aren't feeling your best, you can downshift the weights and make sure you work the muscles until you feel the tension. This can make workouts very productive.
           18:00: In athletics, there are times you want to the muscles to work together, and you need to train that to, but in a controlled way. You need to train muscles both together and separately.
           18:29: There is currently an obsession with total body training, discrediting years of experience with splitting up training.
           20:55: Q: Is doing exercises standing up about involving the whole body chain? JC: If I have a choice between a seated option and a standing option, I prefer the standing option. [ground force -> carry-over effects]
           22:25: Jeff infrequently trains body builders. "That doesn't have as much purpose for me or value."
           22:37: Q: What do clients or YouTube viewers want more than anything?
           22:48: The immediate thing is looking better. Even for athletes outside of the game. People also want to feel better, have no aches or injuries. Many injuries come to JC because they want to get of certain problems.
           24:45: [Consitency] Even if you manage to go to the gym and train for one hour, there are still 23 other hours in the day in which you can ruin what you achieved in the gym by improper nutrition.
           26:00: Training consistently three times per week already requires a high level of commitment, and being consistent with nutrition demands even more commitment.
           26:50: This is why it is important to dumb it down instead of counting macros and calories. If it is too difficult to count macros and calories, you won't be able to be consistent.
           This is why he came up with the simple trick of dividing the plate up: protein in one third, fibers and carbohydrates in the other space.
           28:10: In the remaining two thirds of the plate, put twice as many fibrous carbohydrates than starchy carbohydrates.
           28:25: Examples of good fibrous carbohydrates include broccoli, asparaghus (not necessarily boiled), etc. Make it taste good.
           29:15: Just eating oatmeal with water would be impossible to keep up for 15 years, so he puts other things on top of it.
           30:00: We don't spend enough time finding food we like. For example, whipped cream contains almost no calories.
           30:30: For starchy carbs, sweet potatoes are great; pasta is also great.
           31:00: Jeff is not against carbohydrates, but it is easy to overindulge in them, unlike steaks or fat.
           31:45: Q: We do we overindulge in carbs? Possibly, our bodies naturally crave them. 
           32:12: Carb-exclusive diets cannot last in the long term, and it is not worth investing time in a type of nutrition that you will need to give up eventually.
           33:20: The value of the clock: there are times of the day when I prefer to eat. If you don't plan you meals, you may end up eating sporadically.
           33:55: This is probably why intermittent fasting is successful: it applies rules around timing.
           34:40: If you get hungry around an hour before the next meal and you have fixed meal times, you know when the next meal is coming. Without a set time, it becomes more tempting to just grab food.
           35:05: Jeff does not do intermittent fasting. He does not experiment with his nutrion because he likes where he's at.
           35:30 / 36:00: When trying to get lean, men typically lose fat from their face some time before they lose the fat in the lower belly, especially when they get older.
           36:14: Q: You've said that being lean over time is one of the best things you can do for your later years.
           36:21: After the age of forty it becomes much harder to lose fat and create a certain look.
           37:35: So it's important to start early and turn it into a lifestyle.
           39:00: Q Should everybody be training daily, regardless of age? Not necessarily daily; recovery and having an off-day is important. Recovery can also come in the form of active recovery.
           39:37: However, the commitment to nutrition should be kept up 7 days a week.
           41:49: Cheatmeals can help people maintain their sanity. If your goal is 11-12% bodyfat, then cheatmeals can be worked in strategically a few times per week.
           The problem is that people tend to work in more cheat meals.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Greg Doucette</i> on YouTube, 13 minutes, 24.07.2021).
          <br />In spite of the video's title, the topic is not V Shred but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/esragram_fit/">Esra or esragram_fit</a>,
          who may have listened to much too V Shred. Some of her content is good (for example, <!--6:20-->tracking how her belly fluctuated during the day, showing that you can't have a flat belly during an entire day with normal meals),
          but much of her content is bad or misleading.
          <!--7:45-->For example, she claims she lost a lot of fat by skipping rope for a period of 14 days, losing six centimetres from her waist and 3 centimetres from her hips.
          In fact, during the second week of this experiment, she even replaced lifting weights with 10 minutes of skipping per day. Greg Doucette the results are manipulated by doing the initial measurement after a meal or by calorie deficits during the next two weeks.
          <!--9:00 & 2:48-->She also claims she replaced her long cardio runs with <abbr>HIIT</abbr> training because, in her mind, it burns more calories than hour-long runs. (She might have gotten this from V Shred.)
          <!---->She attributes this effect to <abbr title="excess post-exercise oxygen consumption">EPOC</abbr> (or afterburn).
          <!--3:06-->Greg points out that long study runs burn many more calories than short intense runs; in addition, <abbr>EPOC</abbr> represents only 5 to 6% of the calories that you burn during that cardio,
          so <abbr>EPOC</abbr> is higher on a 60-minute run that on 10 minutes of <abbr>HIIT</abbr>.
          <!--3:55-->Moreover, for the average person, it is much healthier to do longer, moderately intense cardio than to do <abbr>HIIT</abbr> cardio, which should be reserved for advanced athletes.
          <!--4:25-->Most people don't do <abbr>HIIT</abbr> properly, anyway, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> not intensely enough.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Every Damn Day Fitness</i> on YouTube, 12 minutes, 24.11.2019).
          <br />Alan Roberts describes Scott Herman as a &ldquo;reality star&rdquo; but also says he had two post two retraction videos on his YouTube channel.
          One was about a statement by Brad Schoenfeld that he had misunderstood.
          In a more recent video, he talks about &ldquo;newbie gains&rdquo;:
          <q cite="https://youtu.be/18dSfKAA7qo?t=237">The first year that you can train, if you do it perfectly, you can gain 20&ndash;25 pounds of muscle,
          Your second year, you can gain like 15&ndash;20 pounds of muscle, third year, 8 to 12</q>.
          This amounts to up to 57 pounds of muscle gain in the first three years, which is simply fantasy.
          The irony is that this is part of a critque of Greg Doucette, who has a master's degree in kinesiology and has set powerlifting world records.
          Scott Herman then posted a rebuttal video in response to Steve Shaw.
          <!--SH references an older video of his "Bulking: You Are Doing It Wrong! (Stop Wasting Time)"-->
          In this video, he cites a source for some of the numbers from his earlier video<!--Lyall McDonald?-->,
          <!--7:35-->which claims that you can gain 20&ndash;25 pounds of muscle in the first year,
          10&ndash;12 pounds of muscle in the second year, 5&ndash;6 pounds in the third year and 2&dnash;3 pounds from the fourth year on.
          He does not see that this source is based on anecdotal evidence and that they are lower than those in his earlier video.

          (<i class="ytchannel">Shredded Sports Science</i> on YouTube, 11 minutes, 25.11.2019).
          <br />This is a critique of Scott Herman's video &ldquo;INSTA-GAHHHBAGE: They Take Your Money, Time &amp; GAINS! | YOU GET NOTHING?! (Ep.1)&rdquo;,
          posted on 02.09.2019 (23 minutes).<!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HESlecp7h94-->
          Brad Schoenfeld had written on Twitter,
          <q>There are no &ldquo;must do&rdquo; exercises for building muscle. Many viable options exist;
          choose those that suit your needs, abilities and personal preferences.</q>
          Scott Herman countered that there are a lot of must-do exercises.
          James explains that there are individual needs and characteristics, and that there is the physiology of muscle growth.
          See Brad Schoenfeld's article

          <br />One should not confuse &ldquo;very good exercises&rdquo; with &ldquo;must-do exercises for everyone&rdquo;.
          For example, a barbell bench press may not be a good exercise for someone with chronic shoulder issues.
          Scott also misread Schoenfeld's statement as &ldquo;don't challenge yourself&rdquo;.
          It is clear from Schoenfeld's other publications that this interpretation does not make sense.

          The authors propose modifications to the technique to make it safe and effective.
          The bar should be raised through the elbows, not the wrists, and should move as close to the body as possible.
          In addition, the arms should be raised so they make an angle of at most 90° with the upper body.

          <br />There are three questions that need to be distinguished: whether you can develop the same body mass,
          whether you can develop the same muscle mass and be just as lean as Frank Zane, or whether you would look like Frank Zane?
          The answer to the first question is that an <abbr title="fat free mass index">FFMI</abbr> measurement is achievable.
          The answer to the second question is maybe; it is very difficult.
          The answer to the third question is definitely no. For example, Frank Zane had small wrist and ankles
          making his arms, legs very big in comparison. His chest also looked very big in comparison with his waist.

          <br />Luke Zocchi, Chris Hemsworth's personal trainer, explains the workout he designed for Hemsworth for the film <i>Men in Black: Internationalk</i> (2019).
          The workout was designed to achieve a less bulky look than Thor and to be doable while travelling, so it involves only bodyweight and a pair of dumbbells.
          <!--1:30-->It starts with a warm-up that involves bear crawls (10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds) and
          bodyweight squats (also 10 rounds of 20 seconds, with resting periods of 10 seconds).
          <!--2:32-->The other exercises are weighted burpee (8 reps), curl to press (8 reps), goblet squats (8 reps), standing triceps extensions (8 reps), reverse lunge curls (8 reps),
          a shoulder excercise that cycles through a lateral raise, a front raise and an upright row (8 reps), and three plank variations:
          plank punches (8 reps), plank pulses (8 reps) and plank pikes (8 reps).
          This set of exercises are done in a cycle for thirty minutes.
          <br /><strong>Warning</strong>: Skip or replace the upright rows in the shoulder exercise;
          the upright row demonstrated in this video raises the elbows above shoulder level, which brings your shoulders into internal rotation,
          and this can be harmful to the shoulder joints.

          <br />This is a match between a bodybuilder and a practicioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
          Each of them picks three exercises on which both are tested.
          The bodybuilder picks the bench press, the cable row and the barbell curl (50 kilos).
          The jiu-jitsu fighter picks pull-ups on grapple grips, gi-grip toe-to-bars (challenging grip strength, the core and the lats)
          and the &ldquo;man-up&rdquo; (lying down with your partner on your back, getting up and going down again).
          The body builder wins his challenges but loses the three other ones:
          he can do 7 pull-ups from the grapple grips versus 12 for the jiu-jitsu fighter, 4 reps versus 10 on the second exercise
          and 1 rep versus 8 on the third exercise.

    If you want to change what your body looks like, setting a specific goal (e.g. "I need to lose x kilos", "I want to get x% body fat") is better than setting a vague goal (e.g. "I want to look good").
    Specific goals increase your chances of reaching those goals. The video shows the vlogger's body at varying levels of body fat and when the sixpack becomes visible (i.e. at less than 15% body fat).
    For deep cuts in the abs, you should have at most 10% body fat, which is very hard to achieve for longer periods of time for most people.
    5:35: The video than shows how you can calculate your target weight.
    First calculate your "current lean body mass" (CLBM), i.e. your theoretical weight without fat. This can be calculated as follows: CLBM = current weight x (100 - body fat percentage).
    6:18: Then you need to establish your "goal lean body mass" (GLBM), i.e. the percentage of your current lean body mass that will remain. He uses a conservative estimate of 97%.
    7:20: E.g. GLBM = CLBM * 97%. (If you do a lot of cardio, you can lose more; not just fat but also muscle.)
    8:10: Then you calculate your goal weight W = GLBM / (100 - goal body fat %). The vlogger assumes a goal of around 13% body fat, hence W = GLBM / 0.87.
    [CLBM = 60 x (1 - 0.17) = 60 x 0.83 = 49.8; GLBM = 49.8 * 0.97 = 48.306; goal weight = 48.306 / 0.87 = 55.52]
    9:50: Finally, he calculate the "time to six-pack value" or TT6 = (current weight - goal weight) / (rate of weight loss per week).
    11:40: He recommends a rate of weight loss of 0.5 to 1% of your current weight.
    [TT6 = 4.5 k / (0.5 k/week) = 9 weeks.

    Taking in whey protein or anything sweet before, during or after a workout will cause a spike in insulin (and therefore interrupt the fat-burning process).
    The more concentrated the whey protein is, the bigger the spike in insulin will be. However, a normal egg, which contains fat, has a much smaller insulin response than concentrated protein.
    If the goal is to burn fat, eating before, during or after a workout is a bad idea.
    The protein you take in before or after a workout needs at least 24 hours to get digested, go through the liver and end up in the muscles.
    It is the meals you ate the day before that are building your muscles.
    In addition, if your liver is overloaded with too much protein, the protein won't end up in your muscles.
    It is important to know that insulin nullifies growth hormoone. If you eat during the recovery phase after a workout, you will slow down the benefits of weight loss and muscle building.
    The benefits of exercise occur 24 to 48 hours after the workout, during deep sleep phases.
    There are exceptions, however: if you are an athlete, if you work out twice a day, if you are a huge body builder or if you do long-distance running; but these are not what the video is about.
    Most people who exercise want to burn fat. Growth hormone is the main fat-burning hormone that is activated by exercise.
    Since insulin blocks growth hormone and therefore work against the effects of muscle building and lean body mass.
    Growth hormonone is triggered by exercise, sleep and hypoglycemia, so we want to exercise to lower our blood sugar level (i.e. moderate hypoglycemia).
  * "The Truth About The Post-Workout Window - Why You DON'T Need To Eat After Working Out!", SixPackAbs.com, 5 minutes, 03.07.2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfzD2-iZ1E4
    There is not such thing as a 30-minute anabolic window after a workout. According to science, the post-workout window 
    According to a study as McMaster University (Ontario), we have a 50% increase in protein synthesis four hours after a workout, but this rises to 109% 24 hours after the workout.
    The protein synthesis level only starts to decline after 24 hours and does not come back to baseline until 36 hours after the workout.
    Another study looked at 33 individuals. One third of them consumed protein immediately before and after a workout, a second group took in protein in the morning and in the evening,
    and the third group did not make any cognitive changes to their nutrition whatsoever.
    After a ten-week structure-resistance training program, there were no differences between the three groups regarding strength gains,
    cosmetic changns, fat loss or overall protein synthesis. So the moment of protein intake did not make a difference.
  * "Dr. Berg & Thomas DeLauer's Joint Video: The 3 Myths of Muscle Building", SixPackAbs.com, 12 minutes, 27.02.2018: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYCevT0dBac
    Myth 1: We need carbo hydrates to build muscle. We do need insulin build muscle, but if you eat too many carbohydrates, you block insulin.
    High-carbohydrate diets block muscle growth. However, ketones, which increase in low-carb diet, preserve carbohydrates in our muscles.
    4:28: Myth 2: We needs lots of protein to build muscle because are muscles are made of protein. Actually, the body recycles protein and does not lose a lot of it. (+ keto and growth hormone)
    On average, a person needs between three and six ounces of high-quality protein per meal.
    5:52: Studies found that you need only 0.5 - 0.7 grams of protein per pound of body weight if you want to build up muscle.
    If you eat too much protein, you can trigger gluconeogenesis, the conversion of excess protein into sugar, which ultimately gets stored as fat.
    Too much protein can also have a negative effect on your kidneys. It is better to get good quality organic meat. Thomas DeLauer consumes only 90-100 grams of protein per day.
    8:20: Myth 3: Building more muscle will burn more fat. In fact, building more muscle will help you burn more calories.
    So how do we burn more fat calories as opposed to sugar calories. The body needs to learn to burn fat.
    Ketosis means that you are nutritionally priming the body to use fats for fuel during that period of time.
    Fat adaptation goes a step further: your body is so accustomed to using ketones for fuel that it changes its chemistry (the mitochondria) to become more receptive to fat.
    You need to exercise using some intermittent fasting techniques. (See other videos by Thomes DeLauer.)

  * "Creatine From a Medical Point of View",  Dr. Naomi Albertson, 8 minutes, 27.09.2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TxmfGPto89o
    Two of the videos conclusions:
    4:15: (1) Current research shows that taking low amounts of creatine daily (5 grams) is effective in improving muscular strength and improving recovery.
    (2) Creatine absorption is improved with carbohydrate intake and possibly with sodium intake, so it should be taken with a small amount of food to maximize effects.
    Note that Dr. Albertson sells a calcium citrate and creatine powder on her website (https://www.boneandmuscle.com/).

    Fasting -> growth hormone. 
  * "Does Fasting Build Muscle?", biolayne, 5 minutes, 17.10.2017: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1kPX7DoDWw
    See also https://www.biolayne.com/articles/supplementation/growth-hormone-great-expectations/
    xx points out that fasting is not anabolic but protein synthesis is.
    Training fasted or not is a matter of preference.
    Building up muscle consumes energy, but in a fasted state, the body wants to preserve energy, so there is a conflict.
    Giving someone growth hormone leads to an increase in lean body mass, which here means connective tissue and body water, not muscle mass.
    So stop doing things to increase growth hormones.
    Question in the comments: "When Insulin levels are low growth hormone levels are high? meaning low carb diets equal higher growth hormone levels?"
    Biolayne's answer: "only due to substrate mobilization.  Growth hormone is released to mobilize fuel.  Insulin is released to store."
    Question in the comments: "GH doesn't build muscle, but IGF-1 is, right? Because I know GH is converted in the liver to IGF-1. So you can say GH is INDIRECTLY does build muscle?"
    Biolayne's answer: "no.  systemic igf-1 is not anabolic.  only the autocrine IGF-1 released by the muscle cells themselves (also called mechano growth factor or MGF) is anabolic"

    4:38 (https://youtu.be/vfFo5yX9OfA?t=278): "A prolonged fasted state by definition is a catabolic state", i.e. catabolic processes are greater than anabolic processes.
    Being fasted in isolation (!) is not anabolic and does not promote muscle growth.
