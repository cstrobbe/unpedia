          <br />Jeff shows a warmup that use light dumbbells and no stretching. With a dumbbell in each hand, you do five exercises while standing on one leg.
          The first exercise is alternating biceps curls (10 reps for each side), followed by pushing the dummbells up (10 reps for each side), then a movement across and upward (5 reps),
          then down to the ground and up (5 reps) and finally a running-like movement. This then needs to be repeated for the other leg.

          <br />This is a video about thoracic extension and internal rotation of the shoulders.
          Jeff describes how to do the <a href="https://www.ptprogress.com/special-tests/shoulder-special-tests/apley-scratch-test/">Apley Scratch Test</a>

          <br />These are four stretches. The first one is the glute-bridge reach over (10-15 reps to each side).
          The second is the <abbr title="Quadratus Lumborum">QL</abbr> slide (30-45 seconds hold for each side).
          The third is the side pretzel.
          The fourth is the <abbr>NSFW</abbr> (not safe for work; 10-15 repetitions with a two-second hold in the stretch itself).

          <br />If you have an anterior pelvic tilt, you should fix that instead of doing the strechts from this video.
          <br />The program begins with a test: an active knee extension test. You can repeat this test on the last day of the program to measure your progress.
          <br />The program is divided in to three seven-day blocks, followed by the test on day 22.
          Each block consists of two session: one in the morning and one in the evening/at night: one for dynamic exercises and one for static exercises.
          The morning block consists of a stretch that keeps the knee straight and one in which the knee is bent.
          The evening block also consists of a stretch that keeps the knee straight and one in which the knee is bent, but this time in passive stretching.
          <br />The dynamic exercises in block one are a leg swing: one front to back and one side to side. Three sets of 8 repetitions, for each leg.
          The second dynamic exercise is the active knee extension exercise: three sets of six repetitions for each leg (hold for three seconds at the top).
          <br />The evening block consists of the following: (1) a standing low hamstring stretch (two or three repetitions of 45 seconds for each leg) and
          (2) a knee-to-chest stretch (two or three repetitions of 45 seconds for each leg).
          <br />In the second block, the stretches are switched up. The first dynamic stretch is the dynamic downward facing dog (three or four sets of eight repetitions, hold for three seconds on each rep).
          The second stretch is the wall hinge (three or four sets of eight repetitions, hold for three seconds on each rep).
          The first static stretch is the wall plant stretch<!--7:45: "wall plant stretch"; 8:09: "wall plan stretch"--> (two or three repetitions of 45 seconds for each leg).
          The second is the band/towel stretch (two or three repetitions of 45 seconds for each leg).
          <br />In the third block, the first dynamic stretch is the table-top side-to-side stretch (three or four sets of eight reps, both directions or legs).
          The second dynamic stretch is the Bulgarian hamstring stretch (three or four sets of eight reps for each leg).
          The first static stretch is a doorway stretch (two or three repetitions of 45 seconds for each leg).
          The second is a standing high hamstring stretch (two or three repetitions of 45 seconds for each leg).

          <br />This is the first video with a musical intro and the first to mention ATHLEANX.com; Athlean comes from athletic + lean.
          This  is also the first &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video. The The

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hU5dSlWqK8">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 2 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (10 minutes, 24.04.2009).
          <br />This is the second &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video, which assumes you have been doing the exercises from the first video for a while.
          In the introductory part of the video, Jeff stresses the importance of hydration using water instead of coffee.
          He says that you don't need cardio to strip of fat; a combination of diet and strength training should work.
          Instead of worrying about high-carb or low-carb diets, he recommends getting rid of foods that contain a lot of fats
          (sweets, chocolate, butters, cream sauces, mayo, etcetera).
          <br />He then goes on to demonstrate ab exercises that you can do every day of the week.
          (The <a href="https://youtu.be/0hU5dSlWqK8?t=208">actual exercises start at 3:28</a>.)
          The exercises are the ISO reverse crunch, &ldquo;one down, two up&rdquo;, the med ball balance crunch, the commando crunch
          and the standing tubing over twist.
          <br />In the comments, Jeff recommends doing the ab workout three times per week and gradually increasing the frequency to five times per week.

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXadyfFIbQ">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 3 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (8 minutes, 29.04.2009).
          <br />This is the third &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.<!--Mentions that the weather is getting nice in Connecticut, which provides excuses for not working out.-->
          <!--1:58-->Jeff points out that the workouts he describes take only ten minutes, so it should be feasible to fit into your schedule.
          The exercises that Jeff demonstrates are &ldquo;Plate Eight&rdquo;, the Recline Press Crunch, the Side Pillar Twist (also known as Side Plank Rotations),
          the Physioball Rollout and the Physioball Skier Tucks.
        </li>
        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6seGkhzd_4">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 4 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 07.05.2009).
          <br />This is the fourth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          This episode focuses more on speed: you don't need to do a thousand crunches if you slow down the tempo.
          Jeff advises to not only copy his exercises but his tempo as well. He then demonstrates the following exercises:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets of 10 reps), tubing punch and crunch (2 sets of 12 reps each side),
          V-up slow twists (using a medicine ball, 2 sets of 10-12 reps),
          medicine ball &ldquo;2 1 &rdquo; (2 sets of 21 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 3-way x 7) and
          rolling planks (2 sets of 12 complete rolls).

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGdCC1Jomgw">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 5 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 13.05.2009).
          <br />This is the fifth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          Jeff demonstrates a new set of more difficult exercises:
          mad ball plank switches (2 sets of 12 switches each side, using a medicine ball that is small enough so you can grab it using a single hand),
          med ball cross knee tuck (2 sets of 10 to each side),
          figure eights (2 sets of 8 to 10 eights),
          tubing Russian twists (2 sets of 15 reps to each side) and
          physioball running man (2 sets of 12 reps each leg).
          <br />In the second half of the video, Jeff answers a question about nutrition, more particularly cheat meals.
          He says, <q cite="https://youtu.be/EGdCC1Jomgw?t=176">If you stay away from that stuff long enough, you'll start to lose your cravings for it</q>.
          In addition, seeing your gains may increase your willpower to stay away from cheat meals.
          <!--3:25-->If you eat five times per day, as Jeff recommends, totalling 35 meals per week, you can be a little free in what you eat five times.
          However, it is better to consistently eat healthy food.

        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS9C5ml2r_Q">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 6 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 20.05.2009).
          <br />In episode 6 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;,  Jeff first discusses supplements. He points out that many supplements available on the market
          are not good for your health; these include fat burning pills. Instead, you should rev up you metabolism by eating five to six times a day and spreading these meals two to three hours apart.
          However, since eating five to six times per day can be difficult, protein bars and protein shakes can come in handy. Some
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid">fatty acids</a> (omega-3) and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine">creatine</a> (if you drink enough water) can also be good.
          <br />The ab exercises<!--2:05--> he demonstrates are the following:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets until failure), hanging corkscrews (2 sets until failure),
          hanging &ldquo;around the clocks&rdquo; (2 sets until failure), pretzel reverse crunches (2 sets of 15 on each leg; no rest between switching legs) and
          physioball plank marches (2 sets of 12-15 marches for each leg per set).

          <br />In episode 10 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;, Jeff explains that he skipt a week to see what YouTube viewers had been doing:
          skip training, repeat week 9 or something else? He also explains that recovery is important.
          Starting at 2:40, Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:
          three-way ab wheel-outs (3 sets of 12 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 4 rounds of middle, left and right),

        <li class="jeff-shirt-off"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O_QjpC3opI">Lose The Love Handles Workout - Oblique Shredder Workout</a> (6 minutes, 10.10.2009).
          <br />Jeff describes a circuit that consists of the following exercises:
          hanging corkscrews (8 reps for each side),
          physioball tuck circles (8 clockwise and 8 counterclockwise),
          tubing oblique crunches (15 reps in each direction) and
          med ball carry crunches (20 reps for each side).
          This circuit can be repeated three to five times.
          <br />The hanging corkscrews are like hanging leg raises but with a twist at the end to activate the obliques.
          In the physioball tuck circles, it is also important to turn the hips instead of working the hip flexors.
          The tubing oblique crunches can also be done without bands.
          The med ball carry crunches are side crunches with the legs off the floor.

          from the Twilight series has an eightpack and his workout was featured in <i class="magazine">Men's Health</i> in December 2009.
          Jeff shows how his ab routine can be made even better.
          <br />Instead of ordinary leg raises, Jeff recommends hanging clocks.
          The ordinary physioball tucks focus on the hip flexors too much; instead, Jeff recommends putting only one leg on the ball and simulating a running movement.
          The reverse crunches can be done on a <abbr>BOSU</abbr> ball and with reps that add a twist to activate the obliques more.
          Planks can be made more effective by adding a pull (using a band) towards the body.
          Another plank variation pulls the band towards the opposite knee.
          <br />These exercises can be done in a circuit that is repeated three to five times.

          The exercise starts in a sitting position on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of you.
          First, stretch towards the toes, then lean backwards, lift your legs off the floor, bring you hands towards your temples and
          rotate the shoulders to make your left elbow touch the floor, then turn your shoulders the other way to make the right elbow touch the floor.

          <br />The core does not work in isolation, so this needs to be considered in abs workouts.
          The first exercise is a crunch in a push-up like position with the feed suspended by a band attached to a pull-up bar.
          The exercise can be made harder for the upper body by using a lower point of suspension.
          <!--3:30-->A similar exercise can be done without a band but with the feet pushing against a wall and doing a sort of cross-body knee tuck.

          <br />The ranking is based on the following criteria: how multidimensional they are, how scalable they are (from beginner to advanced),
          how much equipment they require and how often people do them incorrectly.
          <br />The ranking starts with the worst ab exercises. The Russian twist is not a bad exercise but it is often turned into a Russian tap (without rotation).
          The bicycle crunch is also meant to be a rotational exercise but is often turned into an exercise that relies on the hip flexors.
          The dumbbell side bend is an inferior exercise; it is more an obliques exercise than an ab exercise, and it can create problems in the lower back.
          The plank is not worth doing if you can do it for a minute or longer; moreover, it is often done without activating the glutes, which turns into a hip flexor exercise.
          The lying leg raise challenges the lower abs, but simply lifting the legs up and down relies too much on the hip flexors and the exercise can cause lower back pain.
          <br />The following exercises are better. The hanging leg raise may fatigue your hands before your abs; it should also be done moving the pelvis up.
          The ab wheel rollout is also often done incorrectly when moving too far back, thereby taking the tension off the abs.
          <br />The category &ldquo;better still&rdquo; has three exercises.
          The hanging knee raise is better than the hanging leg raise because the hip flexors don't dominate the exercise so much, but it has the same grip strength issue.
          The hanging cork screw is not a leg lift but a pelvis left and involves the obliques; it also requires good grip strength.
          The single-sided slow carry also involves the oblliques, preventing a side bend.
          <br />The category &ldquo;almost best&rdquo; contains four exercises.
          The side bridge twist is a better way to do lateral flexion, namely from the bottom up.
          The levitation crunch is a simple and small movement targetting the upper abs (when done correctly): the goal is to lift the shoulder blades off the ground, without pulling your head towards your knees.
          Swipers are a good minimalist exercise for the lower abs: the goal is to move the pelvis off the ground so you can swipe your hands below your tailbone.
          The gymnast ab tuck also focuses on the lower abs.
          <br />The &ldquo;best&rdquo; category contains just one exercise:
          the sliding tuck requires that you curl the pelvis into a posterior pelvic tilt using the abs instead of the hip flexors.

          <br />In this video, Jeff demonstrates three pairs of exercises in a circuit (again with his shirt off).
          <!--1:23-->The first exercise is iron-cross pushup using jump bands that hang down from a bar (about 10 reps).
          <!--2:10-->The second exercise is dips in which he keeps his chin to the chest in order to add more stretch to the lower chest.
          He recommends 10 reps with a slight pause at the bottom of the movement.
          <!--3:02-->You should do two or three rounds of these first two stretching exercises.
          <br /><!--3:07-->This is followed by the contraction part of the workout.
          The first exercise uses a resistance band which is pulled to the front of the chest (arm strethed out), then hold for a bit and then back (10 to 12 reps).
          <!--4:10-->The second exercise is a dumbbell pullover for the upper chest (10&ndash;12 reps).
          You should do two to three rounds of these contraction exercises.

          -->
          <br /><!--5:40-->The last part of the workout consists of compound movements.
          The first exercise is a push-up variation that starts with one hand on the ground and one hand on a med ball.
          At the same time, the leg opposite the side of the med ball is raised off the ground.
          At the top of the push-up movement, the medball is switched to the other hand; at the same time, the leg that is raised is also switched.
          He recommends 20 push-ups.
          <!--6:35-->The last exercise is an incline dumbbell press with the bench set to 40&ndash;45 degrees.
          At the bottom of the movement, there should be a slight pause but the dumbbells should not be lowered below the level of the chest (in order to avoid shoulder problems).
          Jeff recommends 12&ndash;15 reps of this exercises.
          You should do two to three rounds of these compound exercises.

          <br />Jeff is not a great fan of the cable crossover, but he demonstrates a way to improve it, especially for the lower and inner pecs.
          The traditional cable crossover has two downsides: first, many people rely on momentum to finish the movement (by leaning forward),
          second, some people do a pushing movement, which involves the lats and the serratus more, thereby shifting the focus away from the chest.
          <!--2:17-->Jeff recommends the following modifications: first, use a low pulley instead of a high one;
          second, stand with your feet wide apart and hold your hands so your thumbs point towards your thighs;
          third, bring your thumbs towards each other and across. This activates the lower and inner pecs.
          You will probably need to decrease the weight by 50% compared to traditional cable crossovers.
          Adapt the weight so you can do 10&ndash;12 reps.

          <!--2:25-->Jeff also demonstrates a variation of the exercise in which you actually sit up after moving up the dumbbells and then lowering yourself down again for the downward part of the movement.
          This variation also involves the abs.

          <br />The worst category includes the bench flys (due to the risk of damage to the anterior shoulder capsule<!--1:39--> and the risk of pec tears),
          the standing cable press (because it causes more of a challenge to the core than to the chest) and the incline bench press at 60 degrees (or any angle over 50 degrees).
          <br />The better category includes the basic push-up (not challenging enough if you can do more than 30 or 40 reps per set),
          floor flys (as a safer alternative to bench flys that allows more weight) and the underhand dumbbell bench press.
          <br />The &ldquo;better still category&rdquo; includes the twisting push-up (more adduction than the basic push-up),
          cable cross-overs (more adduction), lying cable bench press (more effective for hypertrophy than strength) and
          the dumbbell upper chest pull-over (which can be made to work the upper chest when the elbows are squeezed together).
          <br />The &ldquo;almost best category&rdquo; includes the dip (the better version of the push-up),
          heavy one-arm cross-over (fewer balance issues than the cross-overs, so you can use more weight) and
          the incline bench press as 30&ndash;45 degrees.
          <br />The best exercise is the barbell bench press or the dumbbell bench press, which can drive both strength and hypertrophy.
          The barbell version is better for strength.

          Greg agrees with some of Jeff's claims (for example, the incline bench press) and disagrees with others. Greg thinks that bench flys aren't as risky as Jeff says,
          that most people can still benefit from push-ups (you can add bands or weights, or put your feet higher), that floor flys are not a great exercise,
          that the most people can benefit from cable cross-overs (but he demonstrates a different variation), that the dumbbell pull-over is a lat exercise rather than a chest exercise,
          that the dip can be hard on the shoulders (especially if you lean forward), that the incline bench press should be done at 15 to 30 degrees, etcetera.
          Greg also points out that there are several chest exercises using machines that you can do at most gyms, including the pec deck.

          <br />In the introduction, Jeff points out that the AthleanX website has been revamped, after which he explains
          four biceps exercises that he uses as the foundation of his own workouts.
          <!--2:05-->He starts with a straight-bar biceps curl and explains that he allows a little bit of a cheat on this exercise,
          even though he usually stresses correct form. He demonstrates a biceps curl that focuses on the negative, which takes 4&ndash;5 seconds.
          When the biceps get tired, the (minor) cheat on the upward movements allows more reps focusing on the negative movement.
          <br /><!--3:42-->He then demonstrates a chin-up in which the upward movement does not go all the way up but only to a 90° angle between upper arm and forearm;
          at the top of the movement, you should hold for a second, then do a slow negative (doing 8&ndash;10 reps).
          <br /><!--4:26-->The third exercise is like a curl but using tubes instead of a bar;
          since this is a lighter exercise, the tempo is a bit faster and the rep count is between 30 and 40.
          The advantage of a resistance band compared to a bar is the different strength curve:
          with a bar, the hardest part is when the forearm is parallel to the floor,
          whereas with a band, the movement becomes harder as the forearms move to the top of the movement.
          <br /><!--6:50-->The final exercise is a dead-arm curl: since the easiest position in a regular curl is at the top,
          this curl exercise is done standing in a baseball fielder position, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> bent over,
          so that the hardest part is at the top of the movement. In this exercise, too, you should focus on the negative.
          <br />Jeff also answered many questions in the comments. In one of his comments, he points out,
          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&amp;lc=UgzvlqYEZkSeBWwZH6J4AaABAg">If you're pressed for time, the great way to perform this workout is by alternating biceps and triceps exercises with little to no rest in between sets!
          Do a set of biceps, immediately move to the rested triceps muscles for a set.  By the time you've completed your triceps move, you're biceps have had a chance to recover!
          You can knock out 9-12 sets of each in less than 20 minutes!</blockquote>
          In another comment, he points out that,
          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&amp;lc=UgxWHhGcJuGCuHFRIVt4AaABAg">Biceps are a small muscle group and don't need much volume to stimulate growth!
          Perform 1 round of each of the exercises (minimizing the rest in between to just enough that allows you to recover for the next exercise)...then rest 2 minutes in between the rounds.
          Perform another round.  Limit it to 2-3 total rounds.</blockquote>
          And again:
          <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&amp;lc=Ugx7PoyrZQEujH3qw5F4AaABAg">Biceps are a small muscle group and therefore, to prevent overtraining, respond best to 3 sets of 10-12 reps for about 3 exercises.
          9 sets total is plenty if you are training them with good intensity.  Use an amount of weight that allows you to fail in the given rep range.</blockquote>
          In another comment, he points out that you don't need to train your biceps three times per week; one or twice per week is fine.
          <!--https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtGLpdA5UkI&lc=Ugzo33ZgiuTcq1sb4eR4AaABAg -->

          <br />In response to a request, Jeff shows a triceps workout to complement the earlier biceps workout.
          The exercises in this workout are not done in a circuit; instead, you do one set, rest for 30&ndash;60 seconds, do the next exercise, rest for 30&ndash;60 seconds, and so on.
          After the last exercise, you can go back to the first one again.
          <br /><!--1:10-->The first exercise is kettlebell extensions (while lying on the floor), which you can also do using dumbbells.
          Focus on the negativese and use a weight that is appropriate for 12 reps.
          <!--1:50-->The second exercise is a push-up variation that consists of only the upward part of the dive bomber pushup. He recommends 10&ndash;15 pushups.
          (He says that he has shown the dive bomber pushup before, even though it does not appear on earlier YouTube videos.)
          <!--2:45-->The third and last exercises is triceps kickback while lying on a physioball (with a straight back!).
          When the arms are extended, that position should be held for 2&ndash;3 seconds before bringing the weights down again.
          This exercise also activates the muscles in the back. Jeff recommends 12&ndash;15 reps.

          <br />One of the most abused exercises in the gym is the lying triceps extensions (also known as skull crusher or nose breaker).
          Most people finish the movement to the top with the arms perpendicular to the floor, which takes a lot of stress off the triceps.
          In order to get more of the exercise, the arms should be angled slightly backwards, so the triceps need to keep working.
          <br /><!--2:33-->If you want the arms to end up in a more vertical position, you can modify the exercise so it becomes a combination of the
          close-grip bench press and the lying triceps extension.
          <br />Note that in a later video from 28.06.2020, Jeff shows another modification to the lying triceps extensions that makes them more effecrive.

          <br />This is about a type of biceps curl that Sergio Oliva did to develop his biceps peaks and that Jeff used to do when he still had access to just one dumbbell.
          It is a curl with a single dumbbell in which the palms of the hand support to the plates on one side of the dumbbell instead of gripping the handle.
          This prevents the wrist from contributing to the curl so the biceps need to do more work, especially the long head of the biceps.
          Jesse did this exercise for thirty days instead of traditional dumbbell or barbell curls, while still doing chin-ups and underhand rows.
          This was part of his workout one to three times per week, depending on whether he did a push-pull program or a full-body-workout program,
          so he did the exercise 8 or 9 times over a perod of thirty days. The result is a clear improvement in his biceps peaks.

          <br />Just like the triceps contributes a lot to the volume of the upper arm, the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachioradialis">brachioradialis</a>
          contributes a lot to the volume of the forearm. Jeff uses his muscle markers to show where the brachioradialis
          attaches to the humerus and the radius. Unlike true forearm muscles, the brachioradialis has no action on the wrist.
          <br /><!--2:10-->This leads to the question in what position the forearm should be in order to train this muscle: supinated, neutral or pronated?
          In a supinated position, the biceps does the work of flexing the elbow.<!--2:33--> In a neutral grip position the brachioradialis gets also activated.
          <!--2:47-->However, the brachioradialis can also pronate the forearm, so in order to train the muscle, we need both pronation and flexion.
          <br /><!--3:45-->The first exercise you can do is <strong>reverse barbell curls</strong>,
          using either a straight bar with a lower weight (fully pronated position of the forearm)
          or an EZ bar, which brings the wrists a bit closer to a neutral position, which also allows you to use more weight.
          <br /><!--4:39-->The second exercise you can do is the <strong>reverse lat pull down</strong> (towards and past the head).
          <!--5:30-->Instead of the bar, you can also use the ropes you otherwise use for face pulls.
          <br /><!--5:57-->The third exercise you can do is <strong>battle ropes</strong> using a neutral or a pronated grip.
          <br /><!--6:50-->The fourth exercise you can do is <strong>biceps curls</strong> in which you grip the dumbbells close to the plates in the middle of the body
          and then curl while at the same time turning the forearm into a pronated position.
          <br /><!--7:49-->Finally, putting plates back after you're done with an exercise also activates the brachioradialis and is good gym etiquette.

          <br />The lateral and medial heads of the triceps don't contribute as much mass to the triceps as the long head, which represnts two thirds of the muscle's mass.
          The long head is attached to the shoulder blade, so you need exercises that either apply a better stretch to the long head or that move the arm behind the body for more contraction.
          <br />The lying triceps extension can be done with a better stretch at the bottom of the movement.
          The triceps push-away can be with arms stretching further back to cable machine; at the top of the movement the body should be more upright than in the traditional way of doing the exercise.
          The dumbbell overhead extension can be done with a plate instead of a dumbbell, allowing a bigger stretch at the bottom of the movement; at the same time, the further are less far out to the side.
          <br />The triceps pull-down can be done with an offset grip to allow one arm to move behind the torso, which results in a stronger contract on the long head.

          If you have medial elbow pen, you should probably use more overhand grips. When you do pullups, you need to have the bar deep into your hand.
          For something like a deadlift, you can use a hook grip, in which the index finger and the middle finger reach over to the thumber, thereby reducing the load on the ring finger.

          <br />In order to develop the rear delts, you also need to include external rotation of the shoulders in your workouts.
          The exercise Jeff demonstrates is done lying prone on a physioball and with two dumbbells:
          at the start of the movement, the thumbs are pointing inwards; at the end of the movement, the arms are in a W-position with the thumbs pointing backwards.
          In other words, the exercise is a rear fly that includes external rotation.

          <br />Jeff demonstrates a shoulder and back exercise that uses both bands and dumbbells.
          Since the shoulders and the back typically move together, it makes sense to train them together.
          The bands are attached at shoulder height. You grab the other end of the bands and a pair of dumbbells,
          bring the dumbbells to the height of your shoulders and pull back the elbows (as in a rowing exercise).
          Another variation consists in adding a raise before you pull back the elbows.
          A third variation consists in adding a triceps pushdown before the raise and the rowing movement.

          <br />Many workout programs provide a lot of exercises that involve internal rotation and very few exercises involving external rotation.
          Jeff shows a few mistakes that people make when doing the external rotation exercise with a band or a cable machine:
          they involve the lateral shoulder, they use bad posture (rounded shoulders) or they ignore what the shoulder blade is doing.
          <br /><!--3:37-->The movement of the shoulder blade is relevant to the shoulder joint. Two muscles are responsible for positioning the shoulder blade:
          the serrator interior and the lower traps. Jeff demonstrates two exercises for these muscles.
          <!--4:20-->The first exercises is a &ldquo;plank plus&rdquo;, in which the forearms are on the floor with the palms turned up; in this position, you push the body away from the ground.
          The serratus tries to keep the shoulder blade close to the rib cage.
          <!--5:03-->The exercise the lats can be done in various ways. One is hanging from a bar as for a pull-up and pulling the body up while keeping the arms straight.

          <!--Shirt still on during intro.-->
          For the exercise in this video, you stand with your back against the wall with your arms forming a W with the index finger and the elbow against the wall;
          then you slide up your arms against the wall while keeping your index finger against the wall. At the top of the movement you bring your hands together,
          then you move down again. Do five or six reps of this. After this you should feel less grinding in the shoulders when you raise your arms laterally.

          <br />Reverse flys (which involve horizontal abduction) are not necessarily the best exercise to build the rear delts because you don't reach maximum contraction of the deltoids.
          What you need is a movement that involves transverse extension, which allows more shortening.
          Jeff shows an exercise in which the forearm is supinated and the shoulder is externally rotated. The elbow is pulled behind the body without rotating the torso.
          The exercise can also be done on back day, by leaning back from the ususal position for a lat pulldown but with a underhand grip.

          <br />Calf size is largely determined by genetics but is nevertheless improvable. Jeff gives a few tips to increase calf size.
          First, train each calf separately instead of both at the same time. Second, the Achilles tendon is so strong it can rob the calf muscle of much of the tension,
          so the cadence of the calf exercise needs to be lowered. Jeff recommends doing calf raises with a four-second hold at the bottom and a four-second hold at the top.
          Do three sets per side; if you can do more than 10 reps per side, you need to increase the weight.

          <br />When you do the bent-over row, bad form will compromise how much you can lift and increase the risk of injury.
          The hardest part of the bent-over row is the initial lift, so adding resistance bands that are attached to the top of the squat rack
          can assist you in the initial part of the lift so you can focus more on the squeeze at the top of the movement.

          (The video does not tell you how to strengthen the lower back.)

          <br />In order to prevent lower-back pain, the muscles in the lower back need to work in concert with the glutes. Jeff demonstrates four exercises that can be done at home to prevent lower-back pain.
          <!--1:00-->The first exercise is a frog glute bridge, which also activates the glute medius. Jeff recommends 10 reps holding for five seconds.
          <!--1:39-->The second exercise is lat bridge holds with one leg stretched out. Hold for five seconds for each leg, and alternate ten times without lowering the pelvis.
          <!--2:30-->The third exercise the &ldquo;angel of death&rdquo; (10 reps, 5 seconds up and 5 seconds down).
          <!--3:47-->The fourth exercise is &ldquo;pulsed I's&rdquo; (10 reps; 5 seconds of pulsing and 5 seconds down without relaxing the position).
          <br /><!--4:50-->These exercises should be done frequently; you can do them every day.

          <br />One in four men suffer a hernia at some point in their life. It is not necessarily the weight you lift during a deadlift that causes a hernia,
          but the position of your body. An exercise that can cause hernia is the one-arm dumbbell row.
          The asymmetrical load on the pelvis and the pre-stretched position of leg that's on the side causes pressure on a hole in the abdominals.
          Instead of having one knee on the bench and one foot on the floor, it is better to straddle the bench.
          This causes a symmetrical load on the pelvis that decreases the risk of a hernia.

          <br />Jeff shows a pullup variation that does not only hit the back and the arms but also the core.
          This variation is done as follows: on the first pullup, also raise one leg sideways, bent at the knee, on the second pullup, do the same with the other leg,
          and on the third pullup, pull up to the middle of the movement, then crunch with both legs together.

          <br />Jeff shows a progression that allows you to learn to do pull-ups. As a beginner, you can use a bar at shoulder height and decline your body underneath it.
          Since this makes the exercise rather easy, you should do it with only one arm, which also involves your core more.
          You can then progress from a relatively upright position under the bar to a position that is further under the bar.
          <!--2:37-->Involving the core is important: when you do a normal pullup, you should plug the energy leaks
          by contracting your quads, pointing your toes down, squeezing your legs together, tightening your abs, and then doing your pull-ups.

          <br /><!--1:25-->First, Jeff discusses the prerequisites for pull-up.
          You need good abs<!--after his hernia sugergy, Jeff found it difficult to hang from a bar, whereas planks weren't difficult-->, so you need to do more hanging ab exercises.
          You also need to have a strong deadlift; both the deadlift and the pull-up are pulling movements, and your pull-ups will improve as your deadlift improves.
          You also need to have better scapular strength, which you can improve with exercises such as the straight-arm push-down.
          You also need to keep your body fat in check to improve your strength-to-bodyweight ratio.
          <br /><!--3:32-->Second, Jeff discusses what you need to do when you hang on the pull-up bar.
          The best grip is slightly wider than shoulder width; this has several advantages, such as involving the lats.
          A hook grip will allow you to do more pull-ups but can cause long-term problems by causing stress on the finger flexors and thereby on the medial elbow.
          When training pull-ups routinely, a deeper grip is recommended. The position of the legs is also important. They should not be bent with the heels behind the body;
          instead you need to plug the energy leaks by keeping your legs straight, engage your calves by pointing your toes down, squeezing your quads and your glutes and contracting your abs.
          <br /><!--7:04-->Finally, when doing the pull-ups, you need to look up, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> at your target. You should squeeze the bar with the ring finger and the little finger,
          since these are the weakest fingers. While moving up, pull the bar towards your chest, creating thoracic extension.
          When coming down, you should fully straighten your elbows but you should not end up in a dead hang, destabilising your shoulders.
          Disengaging your shoulders can be bad for the glenoid labrum and can create impingement. You need to maintain space between your ears and and your traps.

      <h3>Press-ups / Push-ups</h3>

        <a href="#circuits-hiit">circuits</a> that Jeff recommends.

          <br />Jeff describes an exercise you can do at the end of a chest workout and that he calls the &ldquo;crazy eights&rdquo;.
          The exercise is a pushup variation with your feet on a big medicine ball and your hands on two smaller, hard medicine balls of different sizes.
          <br />The reps and timings are as follows: perform 8 reps, hold for 8 seconds, perform 7 reps, hold for 7 seconds,
          and so on, until you do 2 reps, hold for 2 seconds and do one more rep.
          You should try to do this one to three times at the end of the workout.
          <br />In one of the comments, Jeff says that you can also do the exercise with med balls that are all the same size;
          <q cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BYwYH0_ORc&amp;lc=UgximaK-cjtCJnkdgEl4AaABAg">The off balance sizes creates a little more instability that makes me work even harder to maintain balance....but same targeted areas regardless of the symmetry of the balls.</q>

          <br />The mechanics of the pushup and the benchpress are much the same. Jeff's checklist covers several aspects of correct form.
          First there are a number of things that you should think of before performing the first rep:
          the head should be in a neutral position; <!--1:58-->the shoulders should be unshrugged; <!--3:12-->the back should be stable,
          which can be achieved by pulling the shoulderblades together; and <!--4:24-->the glutes should be activated.
          <!--6:16-->During the movement, a few other things are important. You should not flare your elbows (which is bad for the shoulders) but turn them down around 30%.
          <!--7:62-->Druing the downward movement, the body should drift forward a bit, so the hands are aligned with the lower chest at the bottom of the movement;
          while pressing, up the body drifts back a bit so the shoulders end up above the hands.
          <!--9:20-->Finally, add a brief pause at the bottom of the movement.

        <li class="jeff-shirt-off"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dOM7OMx8hA">Pushups are KILLING Your Gains!!</a> (5 minutes, 24.04.2019).
          <br />When doing pushups, people often focus on the number they can do. It is important to use the full range of motion:
          touching the ground at the bottom of the movement (without disengaging the body) and locking out at the top of the movement.
          This also changes the cadence and makes the exercises harder. Focusing the counting the reps is not as important as making the reps count.
          If you do the exercises correctly, the number of reps you do will drop by roughly 60%.
          <br />Similarly, when you do pullups, the bottom part of the motion should all the way down, disengaging the lats and straightetning the elbows.
          Similarly, in a squat, you should breaking parallel instead of approaching parallel. What counts is the effect of the exercises on the body,
          not the number of reps in your head.

          <br />Jeff doesn't like push-up workouts that have reps as their goal because the persons who prescribe this type of workouts don't understand the benefits of push-ups.
          This exercise needs to be done to failure. Moreover, there is no adduction in most push-up workouts and this should be added.
          You can hit each part of the upper chest of you use the right push-up variations: you need to vary the angle between the arms and the body to hit the various parts of the pectorals.
          <br />To hit the upper chest, you need an upwards movement. Jeff recommends the knee pushaway for beginners, the prowler pushup for the intermediate level and decline push-ups (with the feet up a wall) for the advanced level.
          You need to hit the upper chest first, because that is typically the weakest part. The exercise should be done to failure,
          and instead of simply resting, you should put in an ab exercise, for example the V-sit hold for beginners or V-sit scissors for the intermediate level, until you're ready for the next set.
          <br />To hit the middle chest, Jeff recommends knee push-ups for beginners, standard push-ups for intermediates, and archer push-ups for the advanced level.
          This exercise is done to failure, followed by a rest period that is filled with the same ab exercise as before.
          <br />To hit the lower chest, Jeff recommends incline push-ups for beginners, the pseudo planche push-up for the intermediate level, and a modified Hindu push-up (with the elbows flaring out a bit to the side) for the advanced level.
          <br />All of these variations keep the hands locked in a fixed position, so it is still necessary to find something that creates more adduction.
          Jeff recommends the twisting knee push-up for beginners, the twisting push⁻up for the intermediate level and the banded cross-over push-up for the advanced level.
          <br />Finally, there should also be an explosive variation: Jeff recommends a lateral knee plyo push-up for beginners, a double hand release push-up for the intermediate level, and the Brock shuffle push-up for the advanced level.
          <br />You should work through this cycle two or three times, with a rest period of two to three minutes between each cycle.

          <br /><!--1:35-->The rolling pushups are pushup with one hand on a medicine ball and in which the med ball switches sides after each pushup.
          <!--1:57-->The triceps pushups are done with both hands on the ball.
          <!--2:23-->The shoulder tosses are performed in a seated position with the feet of the floor, which works both the core and the deltoids.
          <!--2:55-->In the wiper-crunch combo, you first do wiper movements with the med ball between the knees, followed by crunches with the med ball balanded on the lower legs.
          <!--3:36-->The rolling squats start from a supine position and the med ball overhead; you bring the ball forwards and use the momentum to get into a squatting position and stand up.
          <!--4:16-->During the lunges with overhead twist, you raise the ball during the lunge and bring it down again while moving back to the standing position.
          <!--4:40-->The <abbr>RDL</abbr> is a type of lift with the med ball in which one leg is extended backward in the lower part of the movement.
          <!--5:15-->In the curl catches, you throw up the med ball and catch it while slowing down the downward movement.

          kettlebell swings in which the kettlebell switches to the other hand at the top of the swinging movement (30 seconds),
          skier hops with the kettlebell (30 seconds),
          &ldquo;sunrise-sunset&rdquo; wth the kettlebell (30 seconds),
          star-jump pushups (30 seconds),
          twisting pistons (30 seconds),

          single-serving cans of tuna, cheese wedges (individually wrapped), hard-boiled eggs, yogurt.

          <br />One of the comments on the video about the high-protein breakfast claimed that the human body can absorb at most 30 grams of protein per meal.
          Jeff dispells this body-building myth. Some research has shown that protein absorption differs depending on the source of protein: pork, whey, chicken or eggs.
          There is also a difference between protein absorption (getting into the blood stream) and protein utilisation (for example, using it to build muscle).
          When you take in 30 grams of protein, some of it is used by the duodenum itself and some by the liver itself, so you are left with less than 30 grams for other purposes (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> for the muscles).
          <!--6:00-->Studies have shown that if within a day you take in 150 grams of protein from a single meal or five times 30 grams of protein from five meals, the total nitrogen excretion remains the same.
          In addition, muscle growth is not exclusively determined by protein. Blood sugar stability is also important for long-term muscle gains.

          <br />(1) Even doing ab exercises will not help you lose weight or bodyfat; that is a poor approach to weight loss.
          <q cite="https://youtu.be/36636A30XCg?t=121">You will not be able to see your abs if you have fat covering them.</q>
          <br />(2) Some people try cardio as a weight loss approach, <abbr>e.g.</abbr> running, cycling or a high-intensity exercise such as burpees.
          Running is bad for someone who is overweight due to the high impact on the body. In cycling the intensity is too low.
          Burpees are much more effective, but you can't do them for very long. Your conditioninng takes only one hour of your day.
          You need to think about what you do during the other 23 hours. Especially eating the right way is the most challenging aspect of weight loss.
          <br />(3) <!--3:54-->So the most important aspect of weight loss is nutrition. However, dieting is a big mistake. What you need is something you can do consistently.
          <q cite="https://youtu.be/36636A30XCg?t=294">Permanent weight loss comes from adopting an eating style that you can live with,
          that doesn't revolve around deprivation, that doesn't require you to skip foods you enjoy, making you hate eating.<q>

          <br />(5)<!--6:55-->Starting a training program is not very helpful without a change in mindset:

          The third method is the most effective approach.
          <!--5:00-->Jeff uses the example of a person weighing 200 lbs or 91 kilogram and 30% body fat at the start who needs to lose 40 lbs to reach 10% body fat.
          Creating a 500-calories deficit through nutrition and burning 250 calories through training is one way of going about it; this should result in a weight loss of 1.5 lbs (or 0.68 kilo) per week.

          <br />If you want to build muscle, you need a &ldquo;<strong>time under tension</strong>&rdquo; of about 45&ndash;60 seconds.
          If each rep lasted four seconds and you did 12 reps, your muscles would be under tension for 48 seconds;
          that is the origin of the magic number 12.
          Tension exists both in the positive and the negative portion of a repetition;
          for example, when doing pullups, you could do the reps 2 seconds up and 2 seconds down, or 1 second up and 3 seconds down.
          However, a negative movement of three seconds is more challenging.
          If you spend only 20 seconds on a set, as many people do, you miss opportunities for building muscle.

          <br />Jeff shows how you can do a workout even in the kitchen instead of in a room full of equipment.
          If you have a kitchen counter with an angle, you can use it to do dips. Jeff also demonstrates several exercises that you can do on the floor.
          You can do reverse lunges with the back foot on a towel. You can do curls hanging from a counter top or a table top.
          With your feet on the towel, you can even do knee tucks.

          <br />Jeff recommends including a set where you add 10% more weight to the bar (in a Smith machine, unless you have a spotter)
          and doing a few reps. You will fail earlier than with the usual weight, but you will have had a taste of the future.
          You then move back to the original weight and rep out the set.
          In your next workout, you may get more reps with the heavier weight than in the previous workout.
          <br />Jeff calls this the Ebenezer Scrooge technique and it is not specific to the benchpress.

          <br />Hotel gyms often have a lot of cardio equipment and relatively little strength training equipment.
          When the free weights are not heavy enough, you can still benefit from using them by slowing down the reps and shorten the rest times,
          and by using compound sets. If there is enough space, you can also do the bodyweight workouts from Jeff's earlier videos.

          <!--2:24-->Jeff recommends the following exercises: bench press (chest), bent over rows (back), squat or deadlift (legs),
          overhead press (shoulders), barbell curl (biceps) and lying triceps extension (triceps). Each of these exercises is a compount movement and allow
          different muscles to work together. They also allow you to overload.
          <br /><!--3:24-->Instead of doing total body workouts, concentrate movement patterns on particular days. The movement patterns are pushing, pulling and legs.
          Train each once a week. Lighten the bars you use to learn the technique correctly.
          <!--4:45-->Once you get the technique right, you can start adding weight to the bar. As long as the technique remains correct, you can continue adding weight.
          When you start to see progress, you can add a second exercise.

          <br />Muscle soreness is generally created by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentric_training">eccentric training</a> (which Jeff incorrectly pronounces as &ldquo;ecentric&rdquo;).
          Concentric movement shortens the muscle;<!--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_contraction#Concentric_contraction-->
          eccentric movement, which elongates the muscles, causes microtears in the muscle fibres and sparks muscle growth.
          Concentric training can be done without causing much soreness (or any at all), but the negative movement (for example in a curl)
          is an eccentric movement, so it needs to be slowed down instead of letting the weight go.
          Certain exercises, such as cleans and snatches, don't have much of an eccentric movement and can therefore often be done without causing soreness.
          <br /><!--3:16-->According to Jeff, soreness is necessary for muscle growth. But if you are training for strength, soreness is not necessarily what you're after.
          You don't need soreness to get stronger, but if you are training for hypertrophy, you may want muscle soreness.
          <!--3:45-->However, Jeff warns that if you train 30 to 60 minutes per day, soreness will only lead to muscle growth
          if you get everythinng else right outside your training, such as eating and getting enough sleep (for recovery).
          These are areas where people are often less committed.
        </li>
        <li class="jeff-shirt-on"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0BIRPLzohs">Muscle Soreness and Muscle Growth (“BROSCIENCE” REVEALED!)</a> (10 minutes, 19.07.2017).
          <br />Some people claim that muscle soreness has nothing to do with muscle growth; this is broscience.
          Jeff explains three ways in which the body creates muscle growth. Muscle soreness may be necessary eventually when the two other pathways become ineffective.
          <br /><!--2:17-->The fist pathway is progressive overload, using either tension (adding weight) or volume as the driver. Weight cannot be added indefinitely,
          so people resort to increased volume. But this is not necessarily a good thing, because it can cause overuse injuries.
          Increading volume requires spotless form.
          <br /><!--4:20-->The second pathway is metabolic stress, which is characterised by byproducts such as lactate and hydrogen ions.
          This method allows lower loads but requires fortitude to train through the pain and the burn. Occlusion training also relies on this.
          This method requires either continuous tension or contracted position exercises (such as the spider curl).
          <br />The third pathway relies on muscle mechanical damage caused by eccentric overload. This method is easy to apply:
          you simply slow down the eccentric movement. The downside of the soreness caused by this is that you may not be able to train as frequently as otherwise.
          <br />Muscle soreness is not a prerequsite for muscle growth but will eventually be part of the equation. You will need each of the three methods.

          <br /><!--0:33-->(1) The bench dip with the hands forwards puts a lot of stress on the anterior shoulder capsule.
          If you want to do this exercise, your fingers should point outwards. An alternative to this exercise is the cobra pushup.
          <br /><!--1:59-->(2) The plank does not provide enough challenge and promotes bad posture. There are many alternatives to this exercise (in a different video).
          <br /><!--3:01-->(3) The hurdler's hamstring stretch does not really stretch the hamstring and is biomechanically flawed.
          It causes a posterior pelvic tilt, which causes stress on the mid back and the low back.
          To get the hamstring stretch, you need a greater anterior pelvic tilt and reach straight out. A better alternative is the hamstring wall stretch.
          <br /><!--4:48-->(4) The neck bridge puts a lot of pressure on the cervical disks. A better alternative is neck isometrics.
          <br /><!--6:23-->(5) Kipping pullups?? Do normal pullups.
          <br /><!--7:12-->(6) The scorpion mobility drill is sometimes said to increase mobility in the spine. However, the lumbar spine is designed to be stable,
          and you get your mobility from below, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> from the hip. You can also get rotation from the thoracic spine, for examples, as in thoracic spine bar rotations.
          <br /><!--8:36-->(7) The sissy squat creates a tremendous stretch in your quads but there are many things that are wrong with this exercise.
          The knees are too far over the toes and pushing the hips forwards creates a lot of stress on the quadriceps tendon and the patellar tendon.
          Instead, you can do pistol squats, in which the hips go backward instead of forward.
          <br /><!--10:28-->(8) Pushups are a very popular exercise but they can be done incorrectly in many ways, often reducing the range of motion.
          The lowest three inches of the exercises are the most important part, so you need to exploit the full range of motion.

          <br />Jeff demonstrates seven exercises for building muscle without weights, including a technique from Bruce Lee that can be applied to each of these exercises.
          The first exercise is a constant-tension push-up. Between sets, Bruce Lee held his arms into a fully contracted position, holding this for six seconds.
          The second exercise is a dip in which you also squeeze other muscle (shoulders and biceps) and do the exercise slowly.
          After this set, contract the arms for six seconds in a low-angle positions (two or three repetitions of six seconds).
          The third exercise is the pull-up but at a slower speed and while tensing as many other muscles as possible.
          After this exercise, you squeeze and hold the back for six seconds (two or three times).
          The fourth exercise is a constant-tension chin-up with a slow negative movement. This is followed by a six-second biceps squeeze.
          The fifth exercise is a constant-tension version of the cobra push-up, followed up by a six-second triceps contraction.
          The sixth exercise is a handstand push-up, followed by an isometric contraction of the delts.
          The final exercise is constant-tension eccentric step-up and step-down at a slow cadence.

          (2) metabolic conditioning versus steady-state cardio (CrossFit's programs burn more calories than steady-state cardio);
          (3) the team or community.

          (the commercialisation of CrossFit means that anyone can open a &dquo;box&rdquo; after a weekend course for certification);
          (2) technical exercises should remain technical (especially Olympic lifts, which require a lot of practice on the technique) instead of doing them for high reps;
          (3) the concept of training versus exercising (training has a defined purpose; CrossFit is a form of exercising).

          by Ming Jiang et al (<i class="journal">Journal of Zhejiang University-SCIENCE A volume</i>, March 2003) found a 145.7% testoterone concentration level compared to the baseline
          after the seventh day of abstinence.
          <br />Howver, there have been just as many studies that show the direct opposite.

          by Aniruddha Das &amp; Nicole Sawin (<i class="journal">Archives of Sexual Behavior</i>, 2016) found that more masturbation was linked to higher levels of testosterone,
          but the direction of the causation was not clear.
          <br />However, it is too simplitic to claim that higher testosterone levels lead to all sorts of gains. However, there are other hormones that rise when testosterone rises
          in order to keep the body in homeostasis. If masturbation helps you relax before sleep and help you sleep better, your recovery may improve, leading to more muscle growth.

    - Some supplememnts contain magnesium stearate, which is just added to prevent ingredients from sticking to machinery and which your body does not need.
    - Not every gram of protein in a product will actually be absorbed by the body.
    - Stores that sell supplements are often incentivised by a manufacturer to recommend the manufacturer's products, not to tell you what is best for you.
    - Some pre-workout products contain 1,3-dimethylamylamine (dmaa), which should be banned because it is not healthy. (WebMD: https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1258/1-3-dmaa)
    - Nutrition comes first; supplementation makes no sense if your nutrition sucks.

    2:43: "The most dangerous diet in the world is the one you can't stick to." Also stay away from the diet cults, i.e. those who say that there is only one right way to feed yourself.
