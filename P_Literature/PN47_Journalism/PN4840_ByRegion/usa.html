        <br />(In April 2018, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/04/19/technology/youtube-ads-extreme-content-investigation/index.html"><abbr>CNN</abbr></a> deceptively called the Jimmy Dore Show
        <q>a far-left YouTube channel that peddles conspiracy theories, such as the idea that Syrian chemical weapons attacks are hoaxes.</q>
        This statement was heavily criticised by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fte9Q0REVpM" title="'CNN Attacks Jimmy Dore', 20.04.2018">Cenk Uyghur</a> on the Young Turks channel.)

          https://youtu.be/-vJ2C43oIDk?t=4m51s :
          <q>We're stuck with a Jimmy Dore who relentlessly protects Donald Trump from criticisms from the left. And I'm like, "What's really going on here?"
          And I realized, it took me too long to realize, because a lot of times I just don't feel like getting into confrontations, until I do, and when I do
          it looks like what it looked like earlier this week, but I realized this is all for show.
          There is a group of people, particularly who gather around YouTube, who are looking for the left version of Alex Jones.
          They are looking for someone who can just keep them angry, regardless of information, regardless of the truth, regardless of the fact.
          If you can spin everything to be the fault of Hillary Clinton, two years into Trump's administration, then there is an audience for you to make a lot of money off of.
          And Jimmy Dore is profiting off of.</q>
          Jimmy Dore commented on Obama's (late) support for Medicate for All that Obama didn't really mean it; Benjamin Dixon calls this useless contrarianism that is just for clicks.
