  <h2>Introduction (or Warning)</h2>
  <p>The dates in the chronology are based on the 
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar">Julian calendar</a></strong>
    that was in use in Shakespeare's time, and which was not replaced with the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a>
    until the 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750">Calendar (New Style) Act 1750</a>.
    Due to the differences between these two calendars, Shakespeare's birthday is currently celebrated on the wrong day.

  <h2>A Shakespeare Chronology</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt class="date julian-date">26 February 1564</dt>
      <dd>Baptism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a>.
      </dd>
    <dt class="date julian-date">23 April 1564</dt>
      <dd>William Shakespeare's hypothetical date of birth. 
        This date is just three days before his baptism and coincides with
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_George%27s_Day_in_England">Saint George's Day in England</a>.
        Since there are no records about Shakespeare's date of birth
        and due to the differences between the Julian calendar and the current Gregorian calendar,
        Shakespeare's birthday is celebrated on the wrong day. The correct date appears to be 3 May.

      <dd>Francis Meres mentions Shakespeare in his book <i class="booktitle">Palladis Tamia</i>:
        <blockquote><p>As the soul of Euphorbus was thought to live in Pythaogoras:
          so sweet witty soul of Ovid lives in mellifluous and honey-tongued Shakespeare,
          witness his <i class="booktitle">Venus and Adonis</i>, his <i class="booktitle">Lucrece</i>,
          his sugared sonnets among his private friends, &amp;c.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>As Plautus and Seneca are accounted for the best of Comedy and Tragedy among the Latins:
          so Shakespeare among the English is the most excellent in both kinds for the stage.
          For Comedy, witness his <i class="booktitle">Gentlemen of Verona</i>, his <i class="booktitle">Errors</i>,
          his <i class="booktitle">Love's Labour's Lost</i>, his <i class="booktitle">Love's Labour Won</i>,
          his <i class="booktitle">Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and his <i class="booktitle">Merchant of Venice</i>;
          for Tragedy, his <i class="booktitle">Richard the 2</i>, <i class="booktitle">Richard the 3</i>, <i class="booktitle">Henry the 4</i>,
          <i class="booktitle">King John</i>, <i class="booktitle">Titus Andronicus</i> and his <i class="booktitle">Romeo and Juliet</i>.
