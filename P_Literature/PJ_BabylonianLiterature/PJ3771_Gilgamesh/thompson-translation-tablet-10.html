      <p align="center">________________________________</p>
      <p>Unto her (therefore) did Gilgamish speak, to the Wine-maker saying]:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">20.</font></span>“Wine-maker, what didst thou see, that [thy postern (now)] thou hast barréd,<br> Barréd thine inner door, [-barréd thy chamber(?)]?

      <p>“He who enduréd all hardships with me, whom I lovéd dearly,<br> Enkidu,—he who enduréd all hardships with me (is now perish’d),<br> Gone to the common lot of mankind!

      <p></p>
      <p><a name="page_46"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 46</font></a></p>

      <h3>Column III</h3>
      <p>“Gilgamish, why runnest thou, (inasmuch as) the life which thou seekest,<br> Thou canst not find? (For) the gods, in their (first) creation of mortals,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5.</font></span>Death allotted to man, (but) life they retain’d in their keeping.<br> Gilgamish, full be thy belly,<br> Each day and night be thou merry, (and) daily keep holiday revel,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10.</font></span>Each day and night do thou dance and rejoice; (and) fresh be thy raiment,<br> (Aye), let thy head be clean washen, (and) bathe thyself in the water,<br> Cherish the little one holding thy hand; be thy spouse in thy bosom<br> Happy—(for) this is the dower [of man] . . . . .</p>
      <p align="center">(<i>Here the Old Babylonian Version breaks off and we must return to the Assyrian</i>).</p>
      <p align="center">(<i>Gilgamish, dissatisfied with a Wine-maker’s philosophy, would seek further afield</i>).</p>
      <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">15.</font></span>[Gilgamish] (thus) continued his speech to the Wine-maker, (saying),<br> “[Pr’ythee, then], Wine-maker, which is the way unto Uta-Napishtim?<br> [What (is)] its token, I pr’ythee, vouchsafe me, vouchsafe me its token.<br> If it be possible (even) the Ocean (itself) will I traverse,<br> (But) if it should be impossible, (then) will I range o’er the desert.”</p>
      <p align="center">________________________________</p>
      <p align="center">(<i>The Wine-maker, in accordance with tradition, attempts to dissuade him</i>).</p>
      <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">20.</font></span>(Thus) did the Wine-maker answer to him, unto Gilgamish (saying),<br> “There hath been never a crossing, O Gilgamish: never aforetime<br> Anyone, coming thus far, hath been able to traverse the Ocean:<br> Warrior Shamash doth cross it&nbsp;<a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1"><sup>1</sup></font></a>, ’tis true, but who besides Shamash<br> Maketh the traverse?

      <p>(<i>The remainder of this Column in the Assyrian Version is so much mutilated that little can be made out, but what is obviously essential is that Gilgamish meets Ur-Shanabi, but destroys the sails </i>(<i>?</i>)<i> of the boat for some reason.

      <p>(Then) did Ur-Shanabi&nbsp;<a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1"><sup>1</sup></font></a> speak to him (yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying):<br> “Tell to me what is thy name, (for) I am Ur-Shanabi, (henchman),<br> (Aye), of far Uta-Napishtim&nbsp;<a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1"><sup>2</sup></font></a>.” To him&nbsp;<a name="fr_129"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1"><sup>3</sup></font></a> did Gilgamish answer:<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5.</font></span>“Gilgamish, (that) is my name, come hither from Erech(?), E-Anni (?),<br> (One) who hath traversed the Mountains, a wearisome journey of Sunrise,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10.</font></span>Now that I look on thy face, Ur-Shanabi—Uta-Napishtim<br> Let me see also—the Distant one!” Him did Ur-Shanabi [answer],<br> Gilgamish: . . . . . . . . .”</p>
      <p>(<i>In the Assyrian Version Ur-Shanabi presently addresses Gilgamish in exactly the same words as Siduri, the Wine-maker, with the same astonishment at his weather-beaten appearance</i>):</p>

      <h3>Column III</h3>
      <p>(Thus) did Ur-Shanabi speak to him, (yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying)<br> “Why is thy vigour all wasted . . .”</p>
      <p>(<i>It continues thus, to be supplied for ll. </i>2-31<i> from Columns I, </i>33<i>-II, </i>14<i> with due bracketing for the last words, and then the text goes on</i>):</p>
      <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">32.</font></span>Gilgamish (thus) continued his speech to Ur-Shanabi, (saying)<br> “Pr’ythee, Ur-Shanabi, which is [the way unto Uta-Napishtim&nbsp;<a name="fr_130"></a><a href="#fn_116"><font size="1"><sup>1</sup></font></a>?<br> What is its token, I pr’ythee, vouchsafe me, vouchsafe me nits token].<br> If it be possible (even) the Ocean (itself) will I traverse,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">35.</font></span>But if it should be impossible, [(then) will I range o’er the desert].”</p>
      <p align="center">________________________________</p>
      <p>(Thus) did Ur-Shanabi speak to him, (yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying):<br> “Gilgamish, ’tis thine own hand hath hinder’d [thy crossing the Ocean],<br> Thou hast destroyéd the sails(?), (and) hast piercéd (?) the . . .<br> (Now) destroy’d are the sails(?), and the <i>urnu</i> not . . . . .</p>

      <h3>Column IV</h3>
      <p>(Thus) did Ur-Shanabi [answer] him, [(yea), unto Gilgamish, (saying)]:<br> “Gilgamish, take the . . . . away . . . . . . . . . . .<br> Let not the Waters of Death touch thy hand . . . . . .<br> Gilgamish, take thou a second, a third, and a fourth pole (for thrusting),<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">5.</font></span>Gilgamish, take thou a fifth, (and) a sixth, and a seventh (for thrusting),<br> Gilgamish, take thou an eighth, (and) a ninth, and a tenth pole (for thrusting),<br> Gilgamish, take an eleventh, a twelfth pole!” He ceased&nbsp;<a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_122"><font size="1"><sup>4</sup></font></a> from (his) poling,<br> (Aye) with twice-sixty (thrusts); (then) ungirded his loins . . . .<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">10.</font></span>Gilgamish . . . .

      <p align="center">(<i>He reaches Uta-Napishtim</i>).</p>
      <p>Uta-Napishtim look’d into the distance and, inwardly musing,<br> <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">15.</font></span>Said to himself: “(Now), why are [the sails(?)] of the vessel destroyéd,<br> Aye, and one who is not of my . . .

      <p>(<i>Remainder of Column lost, but about l. </i>42<i> it becomes apparent that Uta-Napishtim is asking Gilgamish in exactly the same words as Siduri, the Wine-maker, and Ur-Shanabi “Why is thy vigour </i>(<i>all</i>)<i> wasted?” and so on, down to Column V, l. </i>22<i> “</i>[<i>I</i>]<i>, shall I not also lay me down like him, throughout all eternity never returning?”</i>):</p>
      <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">23.</font></span>Gilgamish (thus) continued his speech unto Uta-Napishtim,<br> “Then [I bethought me], I’ll get hence and see what far Uta-Napishtim</p>
