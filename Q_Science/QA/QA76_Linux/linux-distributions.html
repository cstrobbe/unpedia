  <p>Ubuntu is supported by the <abbr>UK</abbr>-based Canonical <abbr>Ltd.</abbr>, a company founded by Mark Shuttleworth,

    <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1">Microsoft has a majority market share</a> (20 August 2008).
    When the distribution was first released in October 2004, it made a very positive impression due to its ease of installation
    and its focus on user-friendliness.
    It has also been criticised, however. For example, when it replaced the Gnome desktop with Unity (Ubuntu 11.04 to Ubuntu 17.04) and
    when Ubuntu 12.10 would ship with a feature that would forward searches to Amazon.

    (they looked at it very closely and noticed that different types of users had different types of feedback; Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr> was not only meant for new users),
    <!--17:18-->the tension between creating a familiar user experience versus an intuitive user experience
    (Zorin uses a blend of both: some user experience elements are similar across operating systems and for good reasons,
    and if a new user encounters a usability problem, that may put them off Linux. However, the developers don't want Zorin to look exactly like Windows),
    releases that made a bigger impact (version 3, version 8 when Windows XP was losing support, and version 15),
    the expected user base (for example, the Italian city of
    <a href="https://zoringroup.com/blog/2016/04/29/the-city-of-vicenza-is-choosing-zorin-os/">Vicenza switched over from Windows to Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr></a> in 2016),

    <!--39:09-->partnerships with hardware vendor in order to get Zorin <abbr>OS</abbr> preinstalled on computers,
