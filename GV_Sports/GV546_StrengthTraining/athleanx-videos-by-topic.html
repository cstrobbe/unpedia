          <br />This is the first video with a musical intro and the first to mention ATHLEANX.com; Athlean comes from athletic + lean.
          This  is also the first &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video. The The
          <a href="https://youtu.be/Se-CQ-7GjOk?t=134">actual exercises starts at 2:14</a>.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hU5dSlWqK8">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 2 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (10 minutes, 24.04.2009).
          <br />This is the second &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video, which assumes you have been doing the exercises from the first video for a while.
          In the introductory part of the video, Jeff stresses the importance of hydration using water instead of coffee.
          He says that you don't need cardio to strip of fat; a combination of diet and strength training should work.
          Instead of worrying about high-carb or low-carb diets, he recommends getting rid of foods that contain a lot of fats
          (sweets, chocolate, butters, cream sauces, mayo, etcetera).
          <br />He then goes on to demonstrate ab exercises that you can do every day of the week.
          (The <a href="https://youtu.be/0hU5dSlWqK8?t=208">actual exercises start at 3:28</a>.)
          The exercises are the ISO reverse crunch, &ldquo;one down, two up&rdquo;, the med ball balance crunch, the commando crunch
          and the standing tubing over twist.
          <br />In the comments, Jeff recommends doing the ab workout three times per week and gradually increasing the frequency to five times per week.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBXadyfFIbQ">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 3 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (8 minutes, 29.04.2009).
          <br />This is the third &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.<!--Mentions that the weather is getting nice in Connecticut, which provides excuses for not working out.-->
          <!--1:58-->Jeff points out that the workouts he describes take only ten minutes, so it should be feasible to fit into your schedule.
          The exercises that Jeff demonstrates are &ldquo;Plate Eight&rdquo;, the Recline Press Crunch, the Side Pillar Twist (also known as Side Plank Rotations),
          the Physioball Rollout and the Physioball Skier Tucks.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6seGkhzd_4">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 4 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 07.05.2009).
          <br />This is the fourth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          This episode focuses more on speed: you don't need to do a thousand crunches if you slow down the tempo.
          Jeff advises to not only copy his exercises but his tempo as well. He then demonstrates the following exercises:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets of 10 reps), tubing punch and crunch (2 sets of 12 reps each side),
          V-up slow twists (using a medicine ball, 2 sets of 10-12 reps),
          medicine ball &ldquo;2 1 &rdquo; (2 sets of 21 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 3-way x 7) and
          rolling planks (2 sets of 12 complete rolls).
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGdCC1Jomgw">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 5 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 13.05.2009).
          <br />This is the fifth &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo; video.
          Jeff demonstrates a new set of more difficult exercises:
          mad ball plank switches (2 sets of 12 switches each side, using a medicine ball that is small enough so you can grab it using a single hand),
          med ball cross knee tuck (2 sets of 10 to each side),
          figure eights (2 sets of 8 to 10 eights),
          tubing Russian twists (2 sets of 15 reps to each side) and
          physioball running man (2 sets of 12 reps each leg).
          <br />In the second half of the video, Jeff answers a question about nutrition, more particularly cheat meals.
          He says, <q cite="https://youtu.be/EGdCC1Jomgw?t=176">If you stay away from that stuff long enough, you'll start to lose your cravings for it</q>.
          In addition, seeing your gains may increase your willpower to stay away from cheat meals.
          <!--3:25-->If you eat five times per day, as Jeff recommends, totalling 35 meals per week, you can be a little free in what you eat five times.
          However, it is better to consistently eat healthy food.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS9C5ml2r_Q">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 6 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (5 minutes, 20.05.2009).
          <br />In episode 6 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;,  Jeff first discusses supplements. He points out that many supplements available on the market
          are not good for your health; these include fat burning pills. Instead, you should rev up you metabolism by eating five to six times a day and spreading these meals two to three hours apart.
          However, since eating five to six times per day can be difficult, protein bars and protein shakes can come in handy. Some
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid">fatty acids</a> (omega-3) and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creatine">creatine</a> (if you drink enough water) can also be good.
          <br />The ab exercises<!--2:05--> he demonstrates are the following:
          hanging windshield wipers (2 sets until failure), hanging corkscrews (2 sets until failure),
          hanging &ldquo;around the clocks&rdquo; (2 sets until failure), pretzel reverse crunches (2 sets of 15 on each leg; no rest between switching legs) and
          physioball plank marches (2 sets of 12-15 marches for each leg per set).
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYSZQRZGg64">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 7 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (4 minutes, 28.05.2009).
          <br />In episode 7 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;,  Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:
          tubing forklifts (2 sets of 12-15 reps), dumbbell punch and crunch (2 sets of 15 reps on each arm),
          physioball wall crunch (2 sets of 21 reps), rolling jackknifes (2 sets of 15 reps for each leg) and
          sleeping bat crunches (2 sets of 12-15 reps).
          <br />(As in previous videos in this series, there is no guidance on rest times between sets.)

          <br />In episode 8 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;, Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:
          duelling clocks (2 sets of 12 reps, clockwise and counterclockwise),
          crunch and tuck (2 sets of 12 reps: crunch, right tuck, left tuck),
          prayer crunch (2 sets of 10-12 reps),<!--1:58: static view of Jeff shirtless-->
          corkscrews (2 sets of 10-12 reps each direction) and inverted V's (2 sets of 15 reps).

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejUrKCrK_qM">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 9 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (4.5 minutes, 10.06.2009).
          <br />In episode 9 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;, Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:<!--1:33 -->
          Rocky reverse crunches (2 sets until failure), frog crunches (2 sets of 20 reps),
          med ball switches (2 sets of 10-12 reps), med ball side slams (2 sets of 10-12 reps each side) and
          tubing woodchoppers (2 sets of 15 reps each side).
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snpUu_LYuZY">Home Abs Workout Blitz!! - Part 10 - Get 6 Pack Abs</a> (6 minutes, 24.06.2009).
          <br />In episode 10 of &ldquo;washboard Wednesday&rdquo;, Jeff explains that he skipt a week to see what YouTube viewers had been doing:
          skip training, repeat week 9 or something else? He also explains that recovery is important.
          Starting at 2:40, Jeff demonstrates the following exercises:
          three-way ab wheel-outs (3 sets of 12 reps, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> 4 rounds of middle, left and right),
          <abbr>BOSU</abbr> tuck crunch (2 sets of 20 reps),
          hanging knee drops (2 sets of 10 drops for each leg),
          seated around the worlds (moving a medicine ball around your lower body while seated in a V-position;  2 sets of 10 to the right and 10 to the left) and
          wall plank tucks (2 sets of 10-12 on each leg).
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVrALzPc7dM">Plank Progression - From Rookie to RIPPED ABS in 7 Minutes with Planks!</a> (7 minutes, 07.04.2012).
          <br />This video presents a few variations to make the plank exercise more challenging.
          In the first variation, he recommends supporting yourself on your hands instead of on your elbows.
          In the second variation, he puts his feet on a bench.
          In the third variation, he recommends narrowing the base of support, both for the hands and the feet.
          In the final variation, he combines some of the previous principles.

        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIDaXSXjuGc">I HATE PLANKS (and why you should too!)</a> (5 minutes, 15.12.2016).
          <br />Planks is a good exercise but only for those who find it challenging, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> those who can't hold it more than a minute.
          Jeff proposes alternatives that involve rotation and rely solely on body weight.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYX5FpYZA7c">Stop Doing Planks! (DO THIS INSTEAD)</a> (8 minutes, 17.01.2018).
          <br />This video shows more advanced alternatives planks than the video from December 2016. Most of these involve bands or weights.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWEXjdAGCQ">The TRUTH About Planks (IT’S UGLY!)</a> (9 minutes, 04.04.2019).
          <br />This video explains a few weaknesses of the plank exercise and clears up a few mistunderstandings about it (<abbr>e.g.</abbr> benefits for the glutes and posture).
          Near the end of the video, he demonstrates a reverse plank that actually activates the glutes and the interscapular muscles.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4aPUBgmG_o">I Did the “Baby Shark Ab Workout” for 30 Days (THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED!)</a> (6 minutes, 18.08.2019).
          <br />Jesse explains he did the Baby Shark ab challenge for thirty days, which resulted in washboard abs (an eightpack according to Jesse).
          Jeff is sceptical.
          <a href="https://youtu.be/M4aPUBgmG_o?t=137">Jesse demonstrates the baby shark workout</a>.
          Jeff then highlights the positive aspects of the thirty-day challenge: first, consistency: abs should be trained daily;
          <!--4:00-->second, constant tension during the entire exercise; third, the workout uses time as a training variable instead of reps.
          <!--4:36-->Jesse adds that this is a short workout; if it isn't hard enough, you can just repeat it.
          <!--4:53-->As a fourth benefit, Jeff points out that it is easier to train to music; the music may distract you from the burn you feel in your muscles.
          <!--5:11-->However, Jeff also adds that Jesse could have chosen a workout from the Six Pack Promise from ATHLEAN-X (available as an app in the app store).

          <br />Just like the triceps contributes a lot to the volume of the upper arm, the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachioradialis">brachioradialis</a>
          contributes a lot to the volume of the forearm. Jeff uses his muscle markers to show where the brachioradialis
          attaches to the humerus and the radius. Unlike true forearm muscles, the brachioradialis has no action on the wrist.
          <br /><!--2:10-->This leads to the question in what position the forearm should be in order to train this muscle: supinated, neutral or pronated?
          In a supinated position, the biceps does the work of flexing the elbow.<!--2:33--> In a neutral grip position the brachioradialis gets also activated.
          <!--2:47-->However, the brachioradialis can also pronate the forearm, so in order to train the muscle, we need both pronation and flexion.
          <br /><!--3:45-->The first exercise you can do is <strong>reverse barbell curls</strong>,
          using either a straight bar with a lower weight (fully pronated position of the forearm)
          or an EZ bar, which brings the wrists a bit closer to a neutral position, which also allows you to use more weight.
          <br /><!--4:39-->The second exercise you can do is the <strong>reverse lat pull down</strong> (towards and past the head).
          <!--5:30-->Instead of the bar, you can also use the ropes you otherwise use for face pulls.
          <br /><!--5:57-->The third exercise you can do is <strong>battle ropes</strong> using a neutral or a pronated grip.
          <br /><!--6:50-->The fourth exercise you can do is <strong>biceps curls</strong> in which you grip the dumbbells close to the plates in the middle of the body
          and then curl while at the same time turning the forearm into a pronated position.
          <br /><!--7:49-->Finally, putting plates back after you're done with an exercise also activates the brachioradialis and is good gym etiquette.

          <br />Grip strength is <!--1:34-->neuromuscular driven. A loss of grip strength can be a sign that you are overtraining or under-recovering.
          You can test grip strength using a special device, a hand grip dynamometer,<!--1:10, 2:48--> which is rather expensive.
          <!--3:40-->Instead, you can also use a bodyweight scale to get a good approximation of what the dynamometer would say.
          <!--4:40-->If you notice a signification drop in grip strength, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> a 10% drop, you need to change something in your training,
          such as reducing the volume or taking a deload week.

    - Some supplememnts contain magnesium stearate, which is just added to prevent ingredients from sticking to machinery and which your body does not need.
    - Not every gram of protein in a product will actually be absorbed by the body.
    - Stores that sell supplements are often incentivised by a manufacturer to recommend the manufacturer's products, not to tell you what is best for you.
    - Some pre-workout products contain 1,3-dimethylamylamine (dmaa), which should be banned because it is not healthy. (WebMD: https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1258/1-3-dmaa)
    - Nutrition comes first; supplementation makes no sense if your nutrition sucks.
